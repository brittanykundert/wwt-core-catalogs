  that the two lower galaxies - whose combined shape bears some resemblance to that
  of a sleeping baby - are currently interacting. Astronomers have suggested that
  the three galaxies will finally merge.  The size of the image is about 5.3 arcminutes.
  The image is based on data obtained with the VLT FORS1 instrument on ESO&#x27;s
  Very Large Telescope through three different filters, B, V, and R. The data were
  extracted from the ESO Science Archive and fully processed by Henri Boffin (ESO).

description: 'Fomalhaut is one of the brightest stars in the sky. At roughly 25 light-years
  away the star lies especially close to us, and can be seen shining brightly in the
  constellation of Piscis Austrinus (The Southern Fish). This image from the Atacama
  Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) shows Fomalhaut (centre) encircled by
  a ring of dusty debris — this is the first time this scene has been captured at
  such high resolution and sensitivity at millimetre wavelengths. Fomalhaut’s disc
  comprises a mix of cosmic dust and gas from comets in the Fomalhaut system (exocomets),
  released as the exocomets graze past and smash into one another. This turbulent
  environment resembles an early period in our own Solar System known as the Late
  Heavy Bombardment, which occurred approximately four billions years ago. This era
  saw huge numbers of rocky objects hurtle into the inner Solar System and collide
  with the young terrestrial planets, including Earth, where they formed a myriad
  of impact craters — many of which remain visible today on the surfaces of planets
  such as Mercury and Mars. Fomalhaut is known to be surrounded by several discs of
  debris — the one visible in this ALMA image is the outermost one. The ring is approximately
  20 billion kilometers from the central star and about 2 billion kilometers wide.
  Such a relative narrow, eccentric disc can only be produced by the gravitational
  influence of planets in the system, like Jupiter’s gravitational influence on our
  asteroid belt. In 2008 the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope discovered the famous
  exoplanet Fomalhaut b orbiting within this belt, but the planet is not visible in
  this ALMA image. Link:  NRAO press release '

description: This unusual image reveals the aftermath of a catastrophic collision  between
  two galaxies, which happened about one billion years ago. The  result? A single,
  very oddly shaped galaxy named NGC 7252, and curiously  nicknamed the Atoms for
  Peace galaxy. At the heart of this merger remnant lies a fascinating “minispiral”
  — a rotating disc of glowing gas, bursting with star formation. Using the VIsible
  Multi-Object Spectrograph (VIMOS) instrument on ESO’s Very Large Telescope,  astronomers
  were able to measure the movement of the gas within this  disc, allowing them to
  map its rotation. Red regions indicate gas moving  away from us, and blue regions
  towards us. Together, these colours  reveal the galaxy&#x27;s steadily rotating
  centre, as well as highlighting  two flowing streams of hot gas north-west and south-east
  of the central  region. Past studies suggested that the central spiral was rotating  counter
  to  the rest of the galaxy, but by comparing the movement of  stars around  the
  galaxy with the gas ionised by newly formed stars in the minispiral, we now know
  that they are in fact rotating in the same direction. Such a detailed map is possible
  due to the Integral Field Unit (IFU) on VIMOS, allowing astronomers to study the
  gas in NGC 7252 with a  comprehensive &quot;mosaic&quot; view. Much like the way
  a fly observes the  world, an IFU divides its subject into many cells, or pixels,
  generating  a spectrum for every single one. The resulting information is arranged  into
  a 3D data cube, which is particularly useful in studying extended  objects in just
  one shot.

  5 x 5 arcminutes and is a color composite made from g-, r- and i-band images combined

description: This gorgeous image resembles an inky patch of space that has been smudged
  by a giant celestial thumbprint. Actually the object is a planetary nebula named
  PN M 2-53. It was imaged using the Gemini North telescope of the international Gemini
  Observatory, a Program of NSF’s NOIRLab. Planetary nebulae have a wildly misleading
  name, as they have nothing to do with planets — or even exoplanets. The misnomer
  originates from the late 1700s, when astronomers thought that the gaseous structures
  resembled planets. Planetary nebulae are actually formed by some dying stars, right
  at the end of their lives. The layers of gas and dust shed by the dying stars are
  lit by their remaining cores, creating a planetary nebula. Despite its inaccuracy,
  the name has stuck!

description: This pair of galaxies is in the constellation Pegasus. A dynamically
  isolated binary system (number 570 in the catalog of double galaxies compiled by
  Igor Karachentsev), NGC7332 and 7339 are too far apart for obvious interaction (such
  as tails and streamers), although they are almost certainly orbiting around each
  other.  NGC7332 is the brighter galaxy to the right (west) of the image. It shows
  evidence of partial dust lanes, has an extended envelope and possesses a compressed,
  bright, box-like central bulge. It is classified S0(pec), being an intermediate
  lenticular galaxy, and its peculiar tag refers to the unusual box-like shape of
  the central region (sometimes called peanut-shaped).  The accompanying NGC7339 is
  seen edge-on and is thought to be of type Sbc (a mixed spiral), but its orientation
  makes it hard to classify exactly. It is also somewhat dimmer than its companion,
  although at a distance of about sixty million light-years, neither is visible to
  the naked eye.  Receding from us at over eight hundred miles per second, they are
  orbiting each other at about sixty miles per second. This isn&#x27;t as fast as
  it sounds for galaxies which are about a million trillion miles across.  This image
  is a combination of observations made with the Kitt Peak National Observatory&#x27;s
  0.9-meter telescope in November of 1998.

description: This picture of the gravitationally lensed quasar Q2237+0305 and the
  associated lensing spiral galaxy was taken by the 3.5-meter WIYN telescope, on the
  night of October 4, 1999. This system is also known as Huchra&#x27;s Lens, after
  its discoverer, and the Einstein Cross, because it is such an excellent example
  of the phenomenon of gravitational lensing, postulated by Einstein as soon as he
  realised that gravity would be able to bend light and thus could have lens-like
  effects. The four separate appearances of the same redshift 1.7 quasar are created
  by the redshift 0.04 galaxy whose nucleus is nicely bracketed by the quasar images.
  It might seem surprising that such a close alignment exists, with a galaxy exactly
  along the line of sight from Earth to a distant quasar, but one should remember
  that the Universe is large enough that unlikely things happen really quite often.
  This is an especially important example of a gravitational lens, because the close
  alignment of the galaxy nucleus and the quasar mean that the four images undergo
  color and brightness variations with a time scale of only a day or so. These changes
  can be modelled theoretically and easily monitored observationally. This is a two-color
  picture combining red and green images, using careful processing both to reveal
  the strongly blue nature of the quasar, as compared to the galaxy, and to show simultaneously
  the very bright quasar images and the very faint structure of the lensing galaxy.

description: Using the Dark Energy Camera at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory,
  a Program of NSF’s NOIRLab, astronomers are measuring weak gravitational lensing
  to map the distribution of mass in nearby galaxy clusters. As well as producing
  remarkable images like this one, the information will shed light on the relationships
  between the constituent parts of nearby galaxy clusters, such as gas, stellar populations,
  and dark matter. The galaxy cluster Abell 3827 is the subject of this striking image.
  In addition to featuring a field of galaxies and foreground stars, the image is
  overlaid with a map with hues of red, blue and purple. Though they are attractive,
  these colors aren’t for decoration — they represent the distribution of mass in
  the heart of Abell 3827 with red showing the largest mass concentration.
