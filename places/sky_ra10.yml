description: This image of NGC 3359 was obtained with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph
  (GMOS) on the Gemini North telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawai‘i. The circular pinwheel
  shape with the easily recognized spiral arm structure makes it straightforward to
  classify this object as a spiral galaxy, however, it is the presence of the straight
  ‘bar’ in the center of the galaxy that distinguishes NGC 3359 from many other spirals.
  Recent research has shown that the central bar in this galaxy is relatively young;
  it is only 500 million years old (as compared to the several billion year age of
  the galaxy). Astronomers are still trying to understand how large features like
  the bar form and how long they last as a galaxy like NGC 3359 evolves. In addition
  to its central bar NGC 3359 is known for its many regions of star formation (so-called
  [H II] regions) that are visible across its disk. In this image the [H II] regions
  are seen as the light red patches visible throughout the image. There are approximately
  100 [H II] regions in NGC 3359 which makes it an example of intense star formation.
  An example of an [H II] region in our own galaxy, where many tens of young stars
  have recently been born, is the famous Orion Nebula. The color-composite image is
  actually made of four individual images taken in the g (blue), r (green), i (orange)
  and h-alpha (red) filters. NGC 3359 is a moderately large object in the sky. The
  angular size of this image is 4.3 x 5.3 arcminutes. It is a relatively close example
  of a spiral galaxy at a distance of roughly 49 million light-years. NGC 3359 is
  located in the constellation Ursa Major and has an apparent magnitude of 10.5. It
  is easily visible in amateur-sized portable telescopes.

description: This stunning image features NGC 3198, a galaxy that lies about 47 million
  light-years away in the constellation Ursa Major. This image was taken with the
  Mosaic instrument on the 4-meter Nicholas U. Mayall Telescope at Kitt Peak National
  Observatory, a Program of NSF’s NOIRLab, and shows the full extent of the galaxy,
  from the bright central bulge to the tenuous outer reaches of the tightly-wound
  spiral arms. Almost all the objects lurking in the background are galaxies or galaxy
  clusters — a sea of distant galaxies of all shapes, sizes, and orientations. Accurately
  measuring the distance to an astronomical object — everything from our own Sun to
  galaxies such as NGC 3198 — is an age-old challenge for astronomers, and requires
  a combination of measurements and methods. The galaxy at the heart of this image
  has played a part in this astronomical undertaking by allowing astronomers to calibrate
  astronomical distance measurements based on a type of variable star known as a Cepheid
  variable.

description: This glittering image captured by the Nicholas U. Mayall 4-meter Telescope
  at Kitt Peak National Observatory, a Program of NSF’s NOIRLab, shows the irregular
  dwarf galaxy Sextans A, which lies around 4.4 million light-years from Earth. This
  galaxy, which is only a fraction of the size of the Milky Way, has been contorted
  by successive waves of supernova explosions into the roughly square shape we see
  from Earth — a cosmic jewelry box filled with bright young stars. Sextans A is displayed
  in style in this gorgeous image, which showcases the irregular shape of this dwarf
  galaxy. Irregular galaxies such as Sextans A don’t have the regular appearance of
  spiral or elliptical galaxies, but instead display a range of weird and wonderful
  shapes. These galaxies are relatively small, and they are often susceptible to distortions
  resulting from close encounters or collisions with larger galaxies — sometimes leading
  to their irregular shapes. Sextans A is particularly small, measuring only about
  5000 light-years across. Also watch this video for more insights about the image.

description: 'Gas-rich galaxies display a wide range of structures and properties,
  but one thing they all seem to have are some newly formed stars. Images from the
  Survey for Ionization in Neutral Gas Galaxies (SINGG), an NOAO Survey Program (obtained
  with the CTIO 1.5m telescope), are designed to highlight areas of star formation
  in gas rich galaxies. This spiral galaxy is tilted away from our line of sight and
  has one of the highest neutral hydrogen (HI) contents of the single galaxies in
  the SINGG study - nearly 40 billion (4 x 1010) times the mass of the sun. Other
  sources with this much HI turn out to be multiple galaxies. The image is displayed
  so that stars have a cyan-blue appearance, while ionized hydrogen (H-alpha) emission
  appears orange-red to yellow. The H-alpha emission marks where the gas in the galaxies
  has been stripped of electrons, and is now recombining. It takes very hot O stars
  to ionize the gas; these stars have very short lifetimes (a few million years).
  As a result, red tones in these images typically mark the location of newly formed
  hot stars. Gerhardt Meurer of The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, is the
  principal investigator for SINGG. For more information, see: http://sungg.pha.jhu.edu/'

description: This image was made by combining three CCD frames, taken at the Kitt
  Peak National Observatory&#x27;s 0.9-meter telescope in April of 1987. By using
  different filters in front of the monochrome detector, corresponding approximately
  to the primary colors red, green and blue, it is possible to recreate a true color
  picture. Each image was processed to correct for detector sensitivity variations
  and to remove incorrect regions caused by manufacturing defects and by the arrival
  of cosmic rays at the telescope.  The dynamic range in this picture has been compressed
  in order to show both the inner nucleus and the outer structures. In actual fact,
  the central bright-spot is over 350 times as bright as the faint arc structure visible
  in the upper right of the picture. In 1991, a supernova went off in the inner ring
  of NGC3310 near this nucleus.  NGC3310, also known as Arp 217 from its appearance
  in the Atlas and Catalog of Peculiar Galaxies, is an unusual Sbc galaxy in the constellation
  of Ursa Major. More than forty-five million light-years from Earth, it is over forty-seven
  thousand light-years across, when we include the outer low surface brightness areas
  shown quite effectively in this picture. NGC3310 is sometimes referred to as the
  &#x27;bow and arrow&#x27; galaxy, because of the linear jet-like feature running
  from near the center towards the upper right of the picture, and crossing a pronounced
  arc about half-way out. The central region comprises a confused inner ring and a
  very bright, off-center nucleus, with a second very bright HII region embedded in
  the ring. The dynamics of this region are chaotic. There is also considerable hydrogen
  alpha emission throughout this galaxy, indicating active star formation in progress.  NGC3310
  has been interpreted both as a violent ejection, causing the inner turmoil and &#x27;squirting&#x27;
  the &#x27;arrow&#x27; out across the &#x27;bow&#x27;, and as a merger remnant, wherein
  a much smaller system plunged almost directly into the heart of NGC3310, leaving
  the &#x27;arrow&#x27; as a debris trail and disturbing the pre-existing nuclear
  structure.

description: Hubble&#x27;s view of the Carina Nebula shows star birth in a new level
  of detail. The fantasy-like landscape of the nebula is sculpted by the action of
  outflowing winds and scorching ultraviolet radiation from the monster stars that
  inhabit this inferno. In the process, these stars are shredding the surrounding
  material that is the last vestige of the giant cloud from which the stars were born.
  The immense nebula is an estimated 7,500 light-years away in the southern constellation
  Carina the Keel (of the old southern constellation Argo Navis, the ship of Jason
  and the Argonauts, from Greek mythology). This image is a mosaic of the Carina Nebula
  assembled from 48 frames taken with Hubble Space Telescope&#x27;s Advanced Camera
  for Surveys. The Hubble images were taken in the light of ionized hydrogen. Colour
  information was added with data taken at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory
  in Chile. Red corresponds to sulfur, green to hydrogen, and blue to oxygen emission.

description: A 50-trillion-km (33-trillion-mile, or 5 light-year) long section of
  the western wall in the Carina Nebula, as observed with adaptive optics on the Gemini
  South telescope. This mountainous section of the nebula reveals a number of unusual
  structures including a long series of parallel ridges that could be produced by
  a magnetic field, a remarkable almost perfectly smooth wave, and fragments that
  appear to be in the process of being sheared off the cloud by a strong wind. There
  is also evidence for a jet of material ejected from a newly-formed star. The exquisite
  detail seen in the image is in part due to a technology known as adaptive optics,
  which resulted in a ten-fold improvement in the resolution of the research team’s
  observations.
