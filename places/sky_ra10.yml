description: 'This photograph shows an image of the Quasar HE 1013-2136 (center) and
  its surroundings, as obtained with the FORS2 multi-mode instrument at the 8.2-m
  VLT KUEYEN telescope in February 2001. A spectacular arc-like tidal tail stretches
  from the quasar towards south-east (lower-left) over a distance of more than 150,000
  light-years. Another, shorter tidal tail towards the east-northeast is barely visible.
  Technical information: this image is based on an image that was obtained in the
  morning of February 26, 2001 with the FORS2 instrument on VLT KUEYEN. It is composed
  of eight exposures in the I-band filter (effective wavelength 768 nm; FWHM 138 nm),
  lasting a total of 32 min. The combined image has a FWHM of 0.6 arcsec. The field
  shown measures 33 x 33 arcsec 2, or 540,000 x 540,000 light-years 2 projected at
  the distance of the quasar; 1 pixel = 0.2 arcsec. North is up and East is left.'

  a large amount of dust and is therefore not visible. Its position is however indicated
  on the above image. This colour composite is based on images obtained on 26 March
  2003 with FORS1 on UT2 (Kueyen) in four filters (B, V, R and I) for a total exposure
  time of 14 minutes. The observations were done in the framework of a programme aiming
  at studying the physics of Type Ia supernovae. The field of view is 6.15 x 5 arcminutes.
  North is up and East is to the left. The data extraction from the archive, data
  reduction and final colour processing of the image was done by Henri Boffin (ESO).

  by far the best images ever obtained of this galaxy, and they include the first
  deep B-band images.

description: 'This new image of the spiral galaxy NGC 3244 was taken with the help
  of the President of the Czech Republic, Václav Klaus, during his visit to ESO’s
  Paranal Observatory [1], on the night of 6 April 2011. The Czech Republic joined
  ESO in 2007, and this was the first visit of the country’s President to an ESO site.
  This galaxy has attracted considerable interest from astronomers over the past nine
  months, thanks to the violent death of one of its stars, which was discovered on
  27 June 2010. This supernova explosion, now known as Supernova 2010ev (SN 2010ev),
  is still visible as the — now faint — blue dot nestled within one of the thick spiral
  arms just to the left of the galaxy’s nucleus. To the right of  the galaxy, an unremarkable
  foreground star in our own Milky Way, TYC 7713-527-1, shines brightly enough to
  catch our attention. Although the star seems a great deal brighter than SN 2010ev,
  this is actually an illusion created by the large difference in the distances of
  the two objects. The galaxy is much further away, at a distance of about 90 million
  light years, while the star lies thousands of times closer, within our own galaxy.
  At its brightest, SN 2010ev reached an apparent magnitude of about 14, making it
  about 1000 times dimmer than the naked eye can see, but it was still the third brightest
  supernova observed in 2010. In fact, if the supernova had been as close to Earth
  as TYC 7713-527-1, it would have been easily visible to the naked eye, unlike the
  aforementioned star. The image was taken using the FORS2 instrument on the ESO Very
  Large Telescope (VLT). The filters used for the image were B, V and R, which were
  coloured blue, green and red respectively. A framed print of the President’s Galaxy
  has been presented to Václav Klaus, as a memento of his visit to Paranal. Notes

description: 'Not all spiral galaxies have to be picture-perfect to be striking. Messier
  96, also known as NGC 3368, is a case in point: its core is displaced from the centre,
  its gas and dust are distributed asymmetrically and its spiral arms are ill-defined.
  But this portrait, taken with the FORS1 instrument on ESO’s Very Large Telescope,
  shows that imperfection is beauty in Messier 96. The galaxy&#x27;s core is compact
  but glowing, and the dark dust lanes around it move in a delicate swirl towards
  the nucleus. And the spiral arms, patchy rings of young blue stars, are like necklaces
  of blue pearls.   Messier 96 lies in the constellation of Leo (The Lion). It is
  the largest galaxy in the Leo I group of galaxies; including its outermost spiral
  arms, it spans some 100 000 light-years in diameter — about the size of our Milky
  Way. Its graceful imperfections likely result from the gravitational pull of other
  members in the group, or are perhaps due to past galactic encounters.  A multitude
  of background galaxies peers through the dusty spiral. Perhaps the most striking
  of these objects is an edge-on galaxy that — because of a chance alignment — appears
  to interrupt the outermost spiral arm to the upper left of Messier 96&#x27;s core.
  This image was processed by ESO using the observational data found by Oleg Maliy
  from Ukraine, who participated in ESO&#x27;s Hidden Treasures 2010 astrophotography
  competition [1], organised in October–November 2010, for everyone who enjoys making
  beautiful images of the night sky using astronomical data obtained with professional
  telescopes. The image was made with data taken at visible and infrared wavelengths
  through B, V, and I filters.  Notes [1] ESO’s Hidden Treasures 2010 competition
  gave amateur astronomers the opportunity to search through ESO’s vast archives of
  astronomical data, hoping to find a well-hidden gem that needed polishing by the
  entrants. To find out more about Hidden Treasures, visit http://www.eso.org/public/outreach/hiddentreasures/.'

description: The Very Large Telescope has captured another member of the Leo I group
  of galaxies, in the constellation of Leo (The Lion). The galaxy Messier 95 stands
  boldly face-on, offering an ideal view of its spiral structure. The spiral arms
  form an almost perfect circle around the galactic centre before they spread out,
  creating a mane-like effect of which any lion would be proud. Another, perhaps even
  more striking, feature of Messier 95 is its blazing golden core. It contains a nuclear
  star-forming ring, almost 2000 light-years across, where a large proportion of the
  galaxy’s star formation takes place. This phenomenon occurs mostly in barred spiral
  galaxies such as Messier 95 and our home, the Milky Way. In the Leo I group, Messier
  95 is outshone by its brother Messier 96 (see potw1143). Messier 96 is in fact the
  brightest member of the group and — as “leader of the pride” — also gives Leo I
  its alternative name of the M 96 group. Nevertheless, Messier 95 also makes for
  a spectacular image. Stop press! By coincidence Messier 95 is the host of a probable  supernova
  that was first spotted on 17 March 2012. Discovery details are  here. And as another
  coincidence both supernova and galaxy are currently very  close to the brilliant
  planet Mars amongst the stars of Leo. Please note that the observations used to
  make this Picture of the Week were taken before the supernova occurred, and therefore
  the supernova itself does not appear in this image.

  Quasars are the luminous centres of active galaxies, which are kept active by material
  falling onto the central supermassive black hole. This quasar and its surrounding
  cloud are at a redshift larger than 3, meaning that they are seen as they were only
  about 2 billion years after the Big Bang. The cloud of gas (or nebula) surrounding
  the quasar is known to astronomers as an Enormous Lyman-Alpha Nebula (ELAN). These
  types of nebula are massive structures of gas which formed in the early Universe,

  observed rotation of more recent galaxies — was created in the Universe. Thanks
  to the revolutionary MUSE instrument, it is now possible to observe these rare giant

description: This ESO Picture of the Week shows a crescent-shaped cocoon of gas and
  dust  — a nebula known as NGC 3199, which lies 12 000 light-years away from Earth.
  It appears to plough through the star-studded sky like a ship through stormy seas.
  This imagery is very appropriate due to NGC 3199’s location in Carina — a  southern
  constellation which is named after the keel of a ship! NGC 3199 was discovered by
  British astronomer John Herschel in 1834 as he compiled his famous catalogue of
  interesting night sky objects. The nebula has been the subject of numerous observations
  since, including those by ESO’s 8.2-metre Very Large Telescope (eso0310, eso1117),
  and 2.6-metre VLT Survey Telescope (VST). The latter made the observations that
  comprise this image. The nebula’s bright crescent feature is now known to be part
  of a much larger but fainter bubble of gas and dust. The nebula contains a notable
  star named HD 89358, which is an unusual type of extremely hot and massive star
  known as a Wolf-Rayet star. HD 89358 generates incredibly intense stellar winds
  and outflows that smash into and sweep up the surrounding material, contributing
  to NGC 3199’s twisted and lopsided morphology. The VST, which began operations in
  2011, can image a large area of sky at once — an area twice the size of the full
  Moon — with its 256-megapixel camera, OmegaCAM. This allows it to characterise interesting
  objects which its larger neighbour, ESO’s Very Large Telescope, can then explore
  in even greater detail.

description: NGC 3351, also known as Messier 95, was first discovered in 1781 by Pierre
  Méchain, a French astronomer and surveyor who worked alongside Charles Messier.
  NGC 3351 is a type of galaxy known as a barred spiral galaxy and it is located in
  the constellation of Leo (The Lion). New observations of this object have shown
  stellar feedback in action. Stellar feedback is the process of redistributing energy
  into the interstellar medium (the space in between the stars) within star-forming
  galaxies. In this particular galaxy, star formation is occurring in the ring surrounding
  the galaxy nucleus at such a violent rate that massive bubbles of hot gas can actually
  be seen being ejected. This ejected gas can then contribute (both positively and
  negatively) to ongoing star formation within the galaxy. The data for this observation
  were taken with ALMA, the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope and the Very Large Telescope,
  showing once again that scientific collaboration across multiple facilities can
  produce some wonderful results.

  away in the constellation of Hydra, are actually physically unrelated and only appear
  to overlap when viewed from Earth. This unique alignment gives astronomers the opportunity
  to measure many properties of the galaxies, such as how dust absorbs starlight,
  and hence gain insight into their composition and evolution. There is another hidden
  secret in this picture if you look closely at the lower right region: beyond this
  stunning cosmic dance you will find a faint yellowish smudge, the signature of an
  ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG). UDGs are objects as large as the Milky Way but with
  100 – 1000 times fewer stars. These galaxies are extremely faint and lack star-forming

description: This image of NGC 3359 was obtained with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph
  (GMOS) on the Gemini North telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawai‘i. The circular pinwheel
  shape with the easily recognized spiral arm structure makes it straightforward to
  classify this object as a spiral galaxy, however, it is the presence of the straight
  ‘bar’ in the center of the galaxy that distinguishes NGC 3359 from many other spirals.
  Recent research has shown that the central bar in this galaxy is relatively young;
  it is only 500 million years old (as compared to the several billion year age of
  the galaxy). Astronomers are still trying to understand how large features like
  the bar form and how long they last as a galaxy like NGC 3359 evolves. In addition
  to its central bar NGC 3359 is known for its many regions of star formation (so-called
  [H II] regions) that are visible across its disk. In this image the [H II] regions
  are seen as the light red patches visible throughout the image. There are approximately
  100 [H II] regions in NGC 3359 which makes it an example of intense star formation.

  have recently been born, is the famous Orion Nebula. The color-composite image is
  actually made of four individual images taken in the g (blue), r (green), i (orange)
  and h-alpha (red) filters. NGC 3359 is a moderately large object in the sky. The
  angular size of this image is 4.3 x 5.3 arcminutes. It is a relatively close example
  of a spiral galaxy at a distance of roughly 49 million light-years. NGC 3359 is
  located in the constellation Ursa Major and has an apparent magnitude of 10.5. It
  is easily visible in amateur-sized portable telescopes.

  measuring the distance to an astronomical object — everything from our own Sun to
  galaxies such as NGC 3198 — is an age-old challenge for astronomers, and requires
  a combination of measurements and methods. The galaxy at the heart of this image
  has played a part in this astronomical undertaking by allowing astronomers to calibrate
  astronomical distance measurements based on a type of variable star known as a Cepheid
  variable.

description: This glittering image captured by the Nicholas U. Mayall 4-meter Telescope
  at Kitt Peak National Observatory, a Program of NSF’s NOIRLab, shows the irregular
  dwarf galaxy Sextans A, which lies around 4.4 million light-years from Earth. This
  galaxy, which is only a fraction of the size of the Milky Way, has been contorted
  by successive waves of supernova explosions into the roughly square shape we see
  from Earth — a cosmic jewelry box filled with bright young stars. Sextans A is displayed
  in style in this gorgeous image, which showcases the irregular shape of this dwarf
  galaxy. Irregular galaxies such as Sextans A don’t have the regular appearance of
  spiral or elliptical galaxies, but instead display a range of weird and wonderful
  shapes. These galaxies are relatively small, and they are often susceptible to distortions
  resulting from close encounters or collisions with larger galaxies — sometimes leading
  to their irregular shapes. Sextans A is particularly small, measuring only about
  5000 light-years across. Also watch this video for more insights about the image.

description: 'Gas-rich galaxies display a wide range of structures and properties,
  but one thing they all seem to have are some newly formed stars. Images from the
  Survey for Ionization in Neutral Gas Galaxies (SINGG), an NOAO Survey Program (obtained
  with the CTIO 1.5m telescope), are designed to highlight areas of star formation
  in gas rich galaxies. This spiral galaxy is tilted away from our line of sight and
  has one of the highest neutral hydrogen (HI) contents of the single galaxies in
  the SINGG study - nearly 40 billion (4 x 1010) times the mass of the sun. Other
  sources with this much HI turn out to be multiple galaxies. The image is displayed
  so that stars have a cyan-blue appearance, while ionized hydrogen (H-alpha) emission
  appears orange-red to yellow. The H-alpha emission marks where the gas in the galaxies
  has been stripped of electrons, and is now recombining. It takes very hot O stars
  to ionize the gas; these stars have very short lifetimes (a few million years).
  As a result, red tones in these images typically mark the location of newly formed
  hot stars. Gerhardt Meurer of The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, is the
  principal investigator for SINGG. For more information, see: http://sungg.pha.jhu.edu/'

description: This image was made by combining three CCD frames, taken at the Kitt
  Peak National Observatory&#x27;s 0.9-meter telescope in April of 1987. By using
  different filters in front of the monochrome detector, corresponding approximately
  to the primary colors red, green and blue, it is possible to recreate a true color
  picture. Each image was processed to correct for detector sensitivity variations
  and to remove incorrect regions caused by manufacturing defects and by the arrival
  of cosmic rays at the telescope.  The dynamic range in this picture has been compressed
  in order to show both the inner nucleus and the outer structures. In actual fact,
  the central bright-spot is over 350 times as bright as the faint arc structure visible
  in the upper right of the picture. In 1991, a supernova went off in the inner ring
  of NGC3310 near this nucleus.  NGC3310, also known as Arp 217 from its appearance
  in the Atlas and Catalog of Peculiar Galaxies, is an unusual Sbc galaxy in the constellation
  of Ursa Major. More than forty-five million light-years from Earth, it is over forty-seven
  thousand light-years across, when we include the outer low surface brightness areas
  shown quite effectively in this picture. NGC3310 is sometimes referred to as the
  &#x27;bow and arrow&#x27; galaxy, because of the linear jet-like feature running
  from near the center towards the upper right of the picture, and crossing a pronounced
  arc about half-way out. The central region comprises a confused inner ring and a
  very bright, off-center nucleus, with a second very bright HII region embedded in
  the ring. The dynamics of this region are chaotic. There is also considerable hydrogen
  alpha emission throughout this galaxy, indicating active star formation in progress.  NGC3310
  has been interpreted both as a violent ejection, causing the inner turmoil and &#x27;squirting&#x27;
  the &#x27;arrow&#x27; out across the &#x27;bow&#x27;, and as a merger remnant, wherein
  a much smaller system plunged almost directly into the heart of NGC3310, leaving
  the &#x27;arrow&#x27; as a debris trail and disturbing the pre-existing nuclear
  structure.

description: Hubble&#x27;s view of the Carina Nebula shows star birth in a new level
  of detail. The fantasy-like landscape of the nebula is sculpted by the action of
  outflowing winds and scorching ultraviolet radiation from the monster stars that
  inhabit this inferno. In the process, these stars are shredding the surrounding
  material that is the last vestige of the giant cloud from which the stars were born.
  The immense nebula is an estimated 7,500 light-years away in the southern constellation
  Carina the Keel (of the old southern constellation Argo Navis, the ship of Jason
  and the Argonauts, from Greek mythology). This image is a mosaic of the Carina Nebula
  assembled from 48 frames taken with Hubble Space Telescope&#x27;s Advanced Camera
  for Surveys. The Hubble images were taken in the light of ionized hydrogen. Colour
  information was added with data taken at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory
  in Chile. Red corresponds to sulfur, green to hydrogen, and blue to oxygen emission.

description: A 50-trillion-km (33-trillion-mile, or 5 light-year) long section of
  the western wall in the Carina Nebula, as observed with adaptive optics on the Gemini
  South telescope. This mountainous section of the nebula reveals a number of unusual
  structures including a long series of parallel ridges that could be produced by
  a magnetic field, a remarkable almost perfectly smooth wave, and fragments that
  appear to be in the process of being sheared off the cloud by a strong wind. There
  is also evidence for a jet of material ejected from a newly-formed star. The exquisite
  detail seen in the image is in part due to a technology known as adaptive optics,
  which resulted in a ten-fold improvement in the resolution of the research team’s
  observations.
