description: This is a direct image of HE 2347-4342 at the centre of a 7.5 x 7.5 arcmin
  2 sky field.  HE 2347-4342 was discovered in October 1995 by Lutz Wisotzki from
  the University of Hamburg; the &#x27;HE&#x27; stands for Hamburg-ESO . The visual
  magnitude is 16.1, i.e. `only&#x27; 10,000 times fainter than what can be seen with
  the naked eye; this makes it one of the apparently brightest quasars in the sky
  found so far. Still, it is quite distant - the measured redshift is z = 2.885. This
  places it at a distance that implies a look-back time of more than 80% of the age
  of the Universe. We thus observe it, as it was, just a few billion years after the
  Big Bang.  Being so bright in the sky and yet so distant means that HE 2347-4342
  must be one of the intrinsically brightest objects in the Universe. In fact, it
  is no less than 10 15 times more luminous than the Sun, or 10,000 times brighter
  than the entire Milky Way galaxy in which we live.

description: 'Although it looks like the pattern of a shell on the beach, this intriguing
  spiral is in fact astronomical in nature. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
  Array (ALMA) captured this remarkable image of a binary star system, where two stars
  — LL Pegasi and its companion — are locked in a stellar waltz, orbiting around their
  common centre of gravity. The old star LL Pegasi is continuously losing gaseous
  material as it evolves into a planetary nebula, and the distinct spiral shape is
  the imprint made by the stars orbiting in this gas. The spiral spans light-years
  and winds around with extraordinary regularity. Based on the expansion rate of the
  spiralling gas, astronomers estimate that a new “layer” appears every 800 years
  — approximately the same time it takes for the two stars to complete one orbit around
  each other. LL Pegasi was first highlighted about 10 years ago when the NASA/ESA
  Hubble Space Telescope obtained a picture of the almost-perfect spiral structure.
  This was the first time a spiral pattern had been found in material surrounding
  an old star. Now, ALMA’s observations, of which this image only shows one “cross-section”,
  have added an extra dimension to reveal the exquisitely-ordered 3D geometry of the
  spiral pattern. A full view of the 3D video can be seen in this video. An additional
  image shows a composition of the ALMA and Hubble data. Links:  ALMA and Hubble observe

description: 'This image shows something spectacular: a massive galaxy cluster that
  it is warping the space around it! The cluster, whose heart is at the centre of
  the frame, is named RCS2 J2327, and is one of the most massive clusters known at
  its distance or beyond. Massive objects such as RCS2 J2327 have such a strong influence
  on their surroundings that they visibly warp the space around them. This effect
  is known as gravitational lensing. In this way, they cause the light from more distant
  objects to be bent, distorted, and magnified, allowing us to see galaxies that would
  otherwise be far too distant to detect. Gravitational lensing is one of the predictions
  of Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity. Strong lensing produces stunning
  images of distorted galaxies and sweeping arcs; both of which can be seen in this
  image. Weak gravitational lensing, on the other hand, is more subtle, hardly seen
  directly in an image, and is mostly studied statistically — but it provides a way
  to measure the masses of cosmic objects, as in the case of this cluster. This image
  is a composite of observations from the HAWK-I instrument on ESO’s Very Large Telescope
  and the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope’s Advanced Camera for Surveys. It demonstrates
  an impressively detailed collaborative approach to studying weak lensing in the
  cosmos. The study found RCS2 J2327 to contain the mass of two quadrillion Suns!

description: This image reveals a dramatic binary star system named R Aquarii, located
  700 light-years from Earth, as seen in 2012 by ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT).
  R Aquarii is a so-called “symbiotic binary”, comprising two stars surrounded by
  a large, dynamic cloud of gas (a nebula). Systems like this contain two stars in
  an unequal and complex relationship. R Aquarii is made up of one hot white dwarf
  and one red giant. The red giant is losing matter to its small companion and occasionally
  ejecting matter in weird spurts, loops and trails, forming the intriguing shapes
  seen here. There is a lot going on between the performers in this cosmic double
  act. The red giant is a variable star, with a brightness that changes by a factor
  of 750 every year and three weeks. The faint nebula is named Cederblad 211 and is
  thought to be the result of a violent nova 250 years ago. Also visible is a narrow,
  vertical, S-shaped feature, with blobs of superheated material moving outward at
  tremendous speeds of 600 to 850 kilometres per second. R Aquarii was also imaged
  15 years ago — and several times in the intervening period — to track its ongoing
  activity. The system is very dynamic and complex, and has expanded and evolved significantly
  in recent years (an image from 1997 can be seen here, and a comparison between the
  two is available here).

description: Just as people at a busy crossroad may accidentally bump into each other,
  so too can galaxies in the Universe! But in this case, the outcome is more dramatic
  than a small nudge. When two galaxies clash, they merge into each other, giving
  birth to a new, bigger one. One example is the NGC 7727 galaxy, shown in this image
  from ESO’s VLT Survey Telescope (VST) in Chile. Located 89 million light-years away
  from Earth in the constellation Aquarius, NGC 7727 is believed to be the result
  of a clash between two galaxies that occurred about one billion years ago. The consequences
  of this tremendous cosmic bump are still evident in the peculiar, irregular shape
  of NGC 7727 and the streams of stars in its outer regions.  The image was taken
  in visible light as part of the VST-ATLAS survey. The goal of the survey is to map
  a vast region of the Southern Sky — so large you could fit about 19,000 full moons
  in it! By studying the galaxies in this region, astronomers aim to shed new light
  on the nature of dark energy, the mysterious force permeating the Universe and causing
  its accelerating expansion.

  Galaxy, IC 5332 displays beautifully symmetric spiral arms that unwind gracefully
  from a small and compact central bulge.   Actually, IC 5332 features two main spiral
  arms that continually split into more feathery ones as they extend outwards. Pink
  “bubbles” of nebulous matter dot the arms. These are massive regions of glowing
  hydrogen gas and the sites of active star formation.   The abundance of galaxies
  surrounding IC 5332 is a chance alignment with an assortment of more distant galaxies
  providing a extragalactic backdrop. Astronomers suspect that IC 5332 belongs to

description: This observation from the international Gemini Observatory — a Program
  of NSF’s NOIRLab — showcases a flocculent spiral galaxy that lies nearly 12 million
  light-years away in the constellation Sculptor. The word flocculent means “fluffy”
  or “wooly,” and refers to these galaxies’ strangely tufty appearance when compared
  to the elegant spiral arms of galaxies such as Andromeda. The constellation Sculptor
  lies close to the south Galactic pole. This means that celestial objects within
  Sculptor — such as NGC 7793 — can be studied by telescopes in Earth’s southern hemisphere,
  like Gemini South. From its mountaintop perch in the Chilean Andes, Gemini South
  has a spectacular view of intriguing southern-sky objects such as NGC 7793, the
  Magellanic Clouds, and the center of the Milky Way.

  wind of the massive central star (BD+602522, for the cognoscenti), and ionized by
  the same star&#x27;s high-energy light. The Bubble Nebula is in the constellation
  Cassiopeia, and is bright enough to be seen with a small telescope. It is about
  10 light-years across, and is part of a much larger complex of stars and gaseous
  shells. This picture was created from several exposures in each of three filters
  made with the T1KA CCD camera at the Kitt Peak National Observatory&#x27;s 2.1-meter
  telescope in August of 1999. See also the wide-angle view of the Bubble, including

description: This image of Supernova 2002ic was taken at the Swope 1-meter telescope
  at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile on January 7, 2003. The supernova is the bright
  point of light in the center, at the intersection of two background galaxies. The
  host galaxy of the supernova is extremely faint and is not visible. A strong signal
  of hydrogen was detected in ground-based spectroscopic observations of the supernova,
  leading a team of astronomers in Chile and the U.S. to conclude that the source
  of this Type Ia supernova consisted of a white dwarf that suddenly exploded after
  gaining hydrogen gas blown off by its gravitational partner, a common asymptotic
  giant branch (AGB) star three to seven times as massive as the Sun. This is the
  first unambiguous detection of the progenitor of a Type Ia supernova. Four spectroscopic
  observations of SN2002ic were made using the Baade 6.5-meter and 2.5-meter Dupont
  telescopes at Las Campanas between November 2002 and January 2003.

description: The Bubble Nebula (NGC7635) is one of three shells of gas surrounding
  the massive star BD+602522, the bright star near the center of the bubble. Energetic
  radiation from the star ionizes the shell, causing it to glow. About six light-years
  in diameter, the Bubble Nebula is located in the direction of the constellation
  Cassiopeia. The magenta wisps near the bottom-right of the image are an unexpected
  bonus—the wisps are the remnants of a supernova that exploded thousands of years
  ago. This is the first optical image of the supernova remnant, which was discovered
  at radio wavelengths by the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey in 2005.

description: This image was obtained with the wide-field view of the Mosaic camera
  on the Mayall 4-meter telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory. Sh2-174 is an
  unusual ancient planetary nebula. A planetary nebula is created when a low-mass
  star blows off its outer layers at the end of its life. The core of the star remains
  and is called a white dwarf. Usually the white dwarf can be found very near the
  center of the planetary nebula. But in the case of Sh2-174 it off to the right.
  (It is the very blue star near the center of the blue gas). This asymmetry is due
  to the planetary nebula&#x27;s interaction with the interstellar medium that surrounds
  it. The image was generated with observations in the B (blue), I (orange), Hydrogen-alpha
  (red) and Oxygen [OIII] (blue) filters. In this image, North is up, East is to the
  left. This image was the subject of NOAO Press Release 13-01.
