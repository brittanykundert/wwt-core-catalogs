description: This image is a combination of a K-band image from ANTU/ISAAC   with
  two images obtained in the B and R bands with the SUSI-2  optical imager at the
  New Technology Telescope (NTT) on La Silla. Note the relatively high density of
  red galaxies, visible in the upper right part of this image. The colours of most
  of these galaxies are consistent with those of &quot;evolved&quot; galaxies, already
  present when the Universe was only 4 billions years old. The redshift, estimated
  on the basis of the measured colours of the mentioned over-density of yellow galaxies,
  is between 0.6 and 0.7 and that of the red galaxies is between 1 and 1.4.

description: Colour composite photo of the central area of NGC 1316, a giant elliptical
  galaxy in the Fornax cluster of galaxies. Many dark dust clouds and lanes are visible.
  Some of the star-like objects in the field are globular clusters of stars that belong
  to the galaxy. It is based on CCD exposures, obtained with the 8.2-m VLT/ANTU telescope
  and the FORS-1  multi-mode instrument through B (blue), V (green-yellow) and I (here
  rendered as red) filters, respectively. The &quot;pyramids&quot; above and below
  the bright centre of the galaxy and the vertical lines at some of the brighter stars
  are caused by overexposure (&quot;CCD bleeding&quot;). The field measures 6.8 x
  6.8 arcmin 2, with 0.2 arcsec/pixel. The image quality of this composite is about
  0.9 arcsec. North is up and East is left.

description: 'Three-colour composite image of the Chandra Deep Field South (CDF-S),
  obtained with the Wide Field Imager (WFI) camera on the 2.2-m MPG/ESO telescope
  at the ESO La Silla Observatory (Chile). It was produced by the combination of about
  450 images with a total exposure time of nearly 50 hours. The field measures 36
  x 34 square arcminutes ; North is up and East is left. Technical information: The
  very extensive data reduction and colour image processing needed to produce these
  images were performed by Mischa Schirmer and Thomas Erben at the &quot;Wide Field
  Expertise Center&quot; of the Institut für Astrophysik und Extraterrestrische Forschung
  der Universität Bonn (IAEF) in Germany. It was done by means of a software pipeline
  specialised for reduction of multiple CCD wide-field imaging camera data. This pipeline
  is mainly based on publicly available software modules and algorithms (EIS, FLIPS,
  LDAC, Terapix, Wifix).The image was constructed from about 150 exposures in each
  of the following wavebands: B-band (centred at wavelength 456 nm; here rendered
  as blue, 15.8 hours total exposure time), V-band (540 nm; green, 15.6 hours) and
  R-band (652 nm; red, 17.8 hours). Only images taken under sufficiently good observing
  conditions (defined as seeing less than 1.1 arcsec) were included. In total, 450
  images were assembled to produce this colour image, together with about as many
  calibration images (biases, darks and flats). More than 2 Terabyte (TB) of temporary
  files were produced during the extensive data reduction. Parallel processing of
  all data sets took about two weeks on a four-processor Sun Enterprise 450 workstation
  and a 1.8 GHz dual processor Linux PC. The final colour image was assembled in Adobe
  Photoshop. The observations were performed by ESO (GOODS, EIS) and the COMBO-17
  collaboration in the period 1/1999-10/2002.'

  The faintest object seen in the image has a magnitude 26 ; that is, it is 100 million
  times fainter than what can be observed with the unaided eye. The bright elliptical
  galaxy in the lower left quadrant is a dwarf galaxy that is part of a large nearby
  cluster in the Fornax constellation. As for all deep images of the sky, this field
  shows a variety of objects, the brightest punctual sources being stars from our
  galaxy. By far the field is dominated by thousands of faint background galaxies,
  the colours of which are related to the age of their dominant stellar population,
  their dust content and their distance. An Einstein ring is visible in the top right
  part of the image. ESO Press Photo eso0521b zooms-in on the position of the newly

  Cluster, some appearing only as pinpricks of light while others dominate the foreground.
  One of these is the lenticular galaxy NGC 1316. The turbulent past of this much-studied
  galaxy has left it with a delicate structure of loops, arcs and rings that astronomers
  have now imaged in greater detail than ever before with the VLT Survey Telescope.
  This image was processed with the VST-Tube data reduction program. Note that the
  bright stars in this image are surrounded by round features, some orange and some
  pale blue or white, that are caused by reflections within the telescope and camera
  optics. These artifacts are not real celestial objects.

  of the galaxy, as seen in different wavebands. Since different types of objects
  have different brightness in different colours, this method is very useful to locate

  the FORS1 Commissioning Team at the ESO VLT UT1 on 20 September 1998. They were
  taken in ultraviolet (&quot;U-band&quot;) and blue (&quot;B-band&quot;) light. The
  exposure times were 10 min and 6 min, respectively. To obtain this colour-index
  image, the two images were carefully recentered and then divided numerically.  Star
  formation regions that emit strong ultraviolet light therefore appear as particularly

description: This image displays a 0.5° x 0.5° sky area in the direction of the so-called
  AXAF Deep Field in which few bright objects are seen. This photo results from the
  combination of 28 individual WFI exposures behind a B(lue) optical filter with a
  total exposure time of 7 hours. About 100,000 galaxies are visible in the original
  image that encompasses approx. 8000 x 8000 pixels (1 pixel = 0.24 arcsec). The light
  trail of an artificial satellite crosses the field. The High-Res version included
  here has been compressed by a factor of four in order to facilitate transport over
  the Web. North is up and East is left. Twenty-eight exposures with a total integration
  time of 7 hours have been co-added. After each single exposure, the telescope was
  offset by a small angle in order to cover also the gaps between the eight CCD&#x27;s
  in the mosaic and to enable removal of minor cosmetical blemishes of the detectors.
  Since the CCD mosaic of the WFI comprises 67 million pixels, a total of 1,900 million
  data points was thus used to construct this image. The related image processing,
  using the EIS WFI data reduction pipeline, recently developed at ESO, kept a powerful
  workstation fully busy for about 8 hours.

  with the Fornax cluster has led to the birth of many stars, seen here as a boomerang-shaped
  region of young, glowing stars in the galaxy. NGC 1427A exhibits a striking resemblance
  to one of our galactic neighbours, the Large Magellanic Cloud, which has undergone
  similar episodes of star formation, triggered by its interaction with the Milky
  Way. This image has been obtained using the FORS instrument mounted on one of the
  8.2-metre telescopes of ESO’s Very Large Telescope on top of Cerro Paranal, Chile.
  It combines data acquired through four broadband filters (U, B, V, I) and a narrowband
  one (H-alpha).  North is on the left and West is up. The field of view is 7 arcminutes.'

description: Spiralling around, 61 million light-years away in the constellation Fornax
  (the Furnace), NGC 1365 is enormous. At 200000 light-years across, it is one of
  the largest galaxies known to astronomers. This, plus the sharply defined bar of
  old stars across its structure is why it is also known as the Great Barred Spiral
  Galaxy. Astronomers think that the Milky Way may look very similar to this galaxy,
  but at half the size. The bright centre of the galaxy is thought to be due to huge
  amounts of superhot gas ejected from the ring of material circling a central black
  hole. Young luminous hot stars, born out of the interstellar clouds, give the arms
  a prominent appearance and a blue colour. The bar and spiral pattern rotates, with
  one full turn taking about 350 million years. This image combines observations performed
  through three different filters (B, V, R) with the 1.5-metre Danish telescope at
  the ESO La Silla Observatory in Chile.

description: 'For the first time, astronomers have seen a dusty disc of material around
  a young star fragmenting into a multiple star system. This image comprises new observations
  from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), Chile, and reveals
  the process in action! Stars form in cosmic clouds of gas and dust, when the thin
  material in the clouds collapses gravitationally into denser cores that in turn
  draw additional material inward. The infalling material forms a rotating disc around
  the young star, and is slowly consumed. Eventually, the young star gathers enough
  mass to create the necessary temperatures and pressures at its centre to trigger
  nuclear fusion. Stars that have no companion — such as the Sun — are not as common
  as we once thought. In fact, almost half of the stars in our galaxy have at least
  one companion, and some are more sociable still! Previous studies have indicated
  that the stars in multiple systems tend to be either relatively close to each other,
  within about 500 times the Earth-Sun distance (known as an Astronomical Unit or
  AU), or significantly further apart, at over 1000 AU. Given these wildly different
  distances, scientists concluded that there were two main mechanisms producing multiple
  star systems — either the original cloud collapsed unstably and fragmented, each
  subsequent fragment crumpling to form a new star, or the rotating disc around an
  existing star fragmented, with the same result. Systems with larger separations
  likely formed via the former process (as recent observational studies have suggested),
  and closer-knit stellar families via the latter (although there was limited evidence
  of this process). New data from ALMA have now offered observational evidence of
  this conclusion. This image shows the second process in action, as seen in the young
  triple star system L1448 IRS3B. The trio are still deeply embedded within their
  parent cloud in the constellation of Perseus, some 750 light-years from Earth, and
  are hungrily feeding from material in the surrounding disc. ALMA has revealed this
  disc to have a spiral structure, a feature that indicates gravitational instability.

description: This week’s picture shows spectacular ribbons of gas and dust wrapping
  around the pearly centre of the barred spiral galaxy NGC 1398. This galaxy is located
  in the constellation of Fornax (The Furnace), approximately 65 million light-years
  away. Rather than beginning at the very middle of the galaxy and swirling outwards,
  NGC 1398’s graceful spiral arms stem from a straight bar, formed of stars, that
  cuts through the galaxy’s central region. Most spiral galaxies — around two thirds
  — are observed to have this feature, but it’s not yet clear whether or how these
  bars affect a galaxy’s behaviour and development. This image comprises data gathered
  by the FOcal Reducer/low dispersion Spectrograph 2 (FORS2) instrument, mounted on
  ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) at Paranal Observatory, Chile. It shows NGC 1398
  in striking detail, from the dark lanes of dust mottling its spiral arms, through
  to the pink-hued star-forming regions sprinkled throughout its outer regions. This
  image was created as part of the ESO Cosmic Gems programme, an outreach initiative
  to produce images of interesting, intriguing or visually attractive objects using
  ESO telescopes, for the purposes of education and public outreach. The programme
  makes use of telescope time that cannot be used for science observations. All data
  collected may also be suitable for scientific purposes, and are made available to
  astronomers through ESO’s science archive.

description: This strikingly simple and serene view of NGC 1404 — a giant elliptical
  galaxy located 62 million light-years away in the constellation of Fornax (The Furnace)
  — hides the galaxy’s cruel reality. NGC 1404 is one of the galaxies comprising the
  massive Fornax Cluster — and it is slowly falling inwards towards the cluster’s
  core. As it moves towards the cluster’s large centremost galaxy, NGC 1399, the galaxy’s
  reserves of hot gas are being forcibly ripped and stripped away, leaving an elongated
  tell-tale trail of gas in its wake. While not visible in this image, this gas stream
  can be seen clearly in X-ray images of the galaxy; in time, NGC 1404 will lose most
  of its hot gas, and therefore its ability to form new stars. ESO’s Very Large Telescope
  (VLT) captured this image of NGC 1404 with its FORS instrument. The bright foreground
  star to the lower left of the frame is named HD 22862.

description: The MUSE instrument on ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile has
  observed NGC 1365, a double-barred spiral galaxy located about 56 million light-years
  away in the Fornax galaxy cluster, allowing us to construct this spectacular colour
  image. The galaxy is also known as the Great Barred Spiral Galaxy, after its two
  central bar-shaped structures, made up of stars.  The two bars of NGC 1365 are a
  rare phenomenon and are thought to have originated by the combined effects of galaxy
  rotation and the complex dynamics of the stars. Its largest bar of stars, too large
  for its structure to be visible in this image, connects its outer spiral arms to
  its centre. What we can see is the much smaller second bar of stars, nestled within
  the main bar. It is likely this secondary bar acts independently of the main bar,
  rotating more rapidly than the rest of the galaxy. Standing for Multi-Unit Spectroscopic
  Explorer, the MUSE instrument captured this image in optical and infrared light,
  showing the gas and dust in the central region of the galaxy. Installed on Yepun,
  one of the four 8.2-metre telescopes that make up the VLT, the capabilities of this
  instrument have allowed for some of the most comprehensive and detailed studies
  of our Universe to date, including surveys of distant galaxies, supermassive black
  holes and even the source of gravitational waves.

description: Starburst galaxy NGC 1313 is a stellar incubator delivering stars on
  a scale rarely seen in a single galaxy of its size. As imaged by the Gemini South
  8-meter telescope in Chile, a multitude of colorful gas clouds blaze forth from
  the galaxy’s spiral arms — a tell-tale sign that this extragalactic wonder is a
  prolific star factory. Located some 15 million light years away, NGC 1313 is a late-type
  barred spiral galaxy. It is a relatively close galactic neighbor to the Milky Way
  and has a mysterious past. Generally, starburst galaxies show some signs of interaction
  with another galaxy; and a close galactic encounter is usually responsible for sparking
  increased levels of starbirth activity. However, NGC 1313 appears to be a neighborless
  “drifter,” far away from any other packs of galaxies. It is possible that a thousand
  supernovae exploded in a span of just a few million years, forming a “superbubble”
  of gas that triggered star formation as it expanded outward. Another theory is that
  shock waves generated by an unseen companion punching through the disk set off star
  formation like ripples in a pond. Then again, nearby gas clouds may simply be falling
  into (or orbiting) the galaxy, prompting localized starbursts. Whatever the cause,
  NGC 1313’s deformed shape and high rate of star formation remains an extragalactic
  puzzle. Download printable PDF 4.4MB

description: This image of nearby spiral galaxy NGC1313 was taken with the National
  Science Foundation’s Blanco 4-meter telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory
  in Chile.  NGC1313 is a late-type barred spiral galaxy. In visible light, NGC1313
  appears dominated by scattered regions of star formation, giving it a rather ragged
  appearance. The clouds of bluish stars look to have burst into existence at random,
  without the normal trigger of gravitational interaction or even distinct spiral
  processes to prompt them. Deep images show that the outer parts of galaxy are also
  very disturbed.  When observed at radio wavelengths, the galaxy is found to be rich
  in hydrogen, the raw material of stars. The gas circulates around the center of
  the galaxy in a well-ordered way, as opposed to its irregular appearance in visible
  light.  NGC1313 is located about 15 million light-years from Earth in the constellation
  Reticulum.

description: NGC1365 is a giant Seyfert type galaxy in Fornax with a diameter of 200,000
  light years. It is arguably the most prominant barred spiral in the sky. The bar
  rotates clockwise with velocities in the nucleus of 2000 km/sec resulting in one
  rotation in 350 million years. The knots seen along the bar are areas of intense
  star formation which occurs because the bar funnels material into this area to trigger
  star formation. It is thought that the nucleus contains a super massive black hole
  among the dust lanes visible in the image.

  gravity to form the new stars. Prominent in this infrared image are outflows of
  gas being driven by the forming stars, and shocks where these outflows strike the
  cold molecular material in the surrounding cloud. This image was obtained with the
  University of Florida’s near-infrared camera and multi-object spectrometer named
  FLAMINGOS, using the National Science Foundation’s 2.1-meter telescope at Kitt Peak
