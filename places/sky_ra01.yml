description: 'This unique image shows AB7, one of the highest excitation nebulae in
  the Magellanic Clouds (MCs), two satellite galaxies of our own Milky Way. AB7 is
  a binary star, consisting of one WR-star — highly evolved massive star - and a mid-age
  massive companion of spectral type O. These exceptional stars have very strong stellar
  winds: they continuously eject energetic particles — like the &quot;solar wind&quot;
  from the Sun — but some 10 to 1,000 million times more intensely than our star!
  These powerful winds exert an enormous pressure on the surrounding interstellar
  material and forcefully shape those clouds into &quot;bubbles&quot;, well visible
  in the photos by their blue colour. AB7 is particularly remarkable: the associated
  huge nebula and HeII region indicate that this star is one of the, if not the, hottest
  WR-star known so far, with a surface temperature in excess of 120,000 degrees !
  Just outside this nebula, a small network of green filaments is visible — they are
  the remains of another supernova explosion.'

description: NGC 520 — also known as Arp 157 — looks like a galaxy in the midst of
  exploding. In reality, it’s the exact opposite. Two enormous spiral galaxies are
  crashing into each other, melding and forming a new conglomerate. This happens slowly,
  over millions of years — the whole process started some 300 million years ago. The
  object, about 100 000 light-years across, is now in the middle stage of the merging
  process, as the two nuclei haven’t merged yet, but the two discs have. The merger
  features a tail of stars and a prominent dust lane. NGC 520 is one of the brightest
  interacting galaxies in the sky and lies in the direction of Pisces (the Fish),
  approximately 100 million light-years from Earth. This image was taken by the ESO
  Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera attached to the 3.6-metre telescope at La Silla
  in Chile. It is based on data obtained through B, V, R and H-alpha filters.

description: 'This rich scattering of galaxies was captured using the Wide Field Imager
  attached to the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope at ESO’s La Silla Observatory in Chile.
  The thousands of galaxies contained in this small area of sky give a glimpse into
  the Universe’s distant past, whilst also acting as a powerful reminder of the immense
  scale of the cosmos. This image was taken as part of the COMBO-17 project (Classifying
  Objects by Medium-Band Observations in 17 Filters), in which detailed surveys of
  five small patches of sky were made through 17 different coloured filters. The area
  of sky covered by each of the five regions is about the same area as that covered
  by the full Moon. The survey has produced a remarkable haul of celestial specimens.
  For example, across just three of these regions over 25 000 galaxies have been identified.
  Just below the bright stars in the centre of the image is the galaxy cluster Abell
  226. It was first noted by astronomer George Ogden Abell in his catalogue of galaxy
  clusters of 1958. The galaxies in Abell’s clusters, including Abell 226, are only
  up to a few billion light-years away. But behind these objects, even fainter, more
  distant galaxies were hiding. The COMBO-17 study has unveiled these hidden galaxies,
  thanks to long exposure images from the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope at ESO’s La
  Silla Observatory in Chile. Some of the most distant flecks of light visible in
  this photo represent galaxies whose light has been travelling towards us for about
  nine or ten billion years. That means that the galaxies in this image have a great
  variety of ages, some of them are quite similar to the Milky Way, while others reveal
  what the Universe was like when it was much younger. This image was taken using
  three of the 17 filters from the study: B (in blue), V (in green), and R (in red).

  spiral galaxy with well-defined whirling arms. However, the real subject of this
  image is the galaxy&#x27;s brilliant new addition from late July 2013: a Type II
  supernova named SN2013ej that is visible as the brightest star at the bottom left
  of the image. Such supernovae occur when the core of a massive star collapses due
  to its own gravity at the end of its life. This collapse results in a massive explosion
  that ejects material far into space. The resulting detonation can be more brilliant
  than the entire galaxy that hosts it and can be visible to observers for weeks,
  or even months. PESSTO (Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey for Transient Objects) is
  designed to study objects that appear briefly in the night sky, such as supernovae.
  It does this by utilising a number of instruments on the NTT (New Technology Telescope),
  located at ESO&#x27;s La Silla Observatory in Chile. This new picture of SN2013ej
  was obtained using the NTT during the course of this survey. SN2013ej is the third
  supernova to have been observed in Messier 74 since the turn of the millennium,
  the other two being SN 2002ap and SN 2003gd. It was first reported on 25 July 2013
  by the KAIT telescope team in California, and the first &quot;precovery image&quot;
  was taken by amateur astronomer Christina Feliciano, who used the public access
  SLOOH Space Camera to look at the region in the days and hours immediately before
  the explosion. Messier 74, in the constellation of Pisces (The Fish), is one of
  the most difficult Messier objects for amateur astronomers to spot due to its low
  surface brightness, but SN2013ej should still be visible to careful amateur astronomers
  over the next few weeks as a faint and fading star. Links  PESSTO (the &quot;Public

description: 'This ghostly image features a distant and pulsating red giant star known
  as R Sculptoris. Situated 1200 light-years away in the constellation of Sculptor,
  R Sculptoris is something known as a carbon-rich  asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
  star, meaning that it is nearing the end of its life. At this stage, low- and intermediate-mass
  stars cool off, create extended atmospheres, and lose a lot of their mass — they
  are on their way to becoming spectacular planetary nebulae. While the basics of
  this mass-loss process are understood, astronomers are still investigating how it
  begins near the surface of the star. The amount of mass lost by a star actually
  has huge implications for its stellar evolution, altering its future, and leading
  to different types of planetary nebulae. As AGB stars end their lives as planetary
  nebulae, they produce a vast range of elements — including 50% of elements heavier
  than iron — which are then released into the Universe and used to make new stars,
  planets, moons, and eventually the building blocks of life. One particularly intriguing
  feature of R Sculptoris is its dominant bright spot, which looks to be two or three
  times brighter than the other regions. The astronomers that captured this wonderful
  image, using ESO’s Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), have concluded that
  R Sculptoris is surrounded by giant “clumps” of stellar dust that are peeling away
  from the shedding star. This bright spot is, in fact, a region around the star with
  little to no dust, allowing us to look deeper into the stellar surface. This image
  captures an extremely small section of the sky: approximately 20x20 milliarcseconds.
  For comparison, Jupiter has an angular size of approximately 40 arcseconds. Links   Research

description: This image shows a dwarf galaxy in the southern constellation of Phoenix
  named, for obvious reasons, the Phoenix Dwarf. The Phoenix Dwarf is unique in that
  it cannot be classified according to the usual scheme for dwarf galaxies; while
  its shape would label it as a spheroidal dwarf galaxy — which do not contain enough
  gas to form new stars — studies have shown the galaxy to have an associated cloud
  of gas nearby, hinting at recent star formation, and a population of young stars.
  The gas cloud does not lie within the galaxy itself, but is still gravitationally
  bound to it — meaning that it will eventually fall back into the galaxy over time.
  Since the cloud is close by, it’s likely that the process that flung it outwards
  it is still ongoing. After studying the shape of the gas cloud, astronomers suspect
  the most likely cause of the ejection to be supernova explosions within the galaxy.
  The data to create this image was selected from the ESO archive as part of the Hidden

description: Gemini North image of interacting galaxies NGC 520. NGC 520 has a unique
  shape that is the result of two galaxies colliding with each other. One galaxy’s
  dust lane can be seen easily in the foreground and a distinct tail is visible at
  bottom center. These features are a result of the gravitational interactions that
  have robbed both of the galaxies of their original shapes. Some astronomers speculate
  that each member of the pair was originally similar to the Milky Way and Andromeda
  Galaxy. This collision could be providing us a glimpse at what might happen to our
  own galaxy in about five billion years as the Andromeda Galaxy collides with our
  Milky Way. Estimated to lie some 100 million light-years away in the direction of
  the constellation Pisces, these galaxies have likely changed significantly in the
  time it has taken for their light to reach us. This view may be fairly early in
  the galactic dance that these galaxies have been performing. Hints of star formation
  (faint red glowing areas above and beneath the middle of the image) may have become
  more pronounced during the course of the collision. Many background galaxies also
  appear in this image. They represent galaxy evolution at an even earlier epoch in
  the history of the universe.

description: '&quot;This Gemini North telescope image captures the “bloody” aftermath
  of one galaxy piercing the heart of another. All the action appears in a single
  frame, with the stunning polar-ring galaxy NGC 660 as the focus of attention. NGC
  660 spans some 40,000 light years across and lies about 40 million light years distant
  in the direction of the constellation of Pisces. It has an unusually high gas content
  and resolves into hundreds of objects, a considerable fraction of which are blue
  and red supergiant stars. The ring’s youngest detected stars formed only about seven
  million years ago, indicating a long and ongoing process of formation. As NGC 660’s
  ring is not truly polar, but inclined ~45˚ from the plane of the disk, it most likely
  formed by a previous interaction with a gas-rich galaxy about a billion years ago.
  That event would have stripped the interloper of its gas, directed it into NGC 660’s
  core, and triggered a furious burst of star formation. When the resulting short-lived,
  massive stars exploded shortly thereafter as supernovae, they would have generated
  shock waves that triggered more star formation, and so on, even to this day. &quot;
  This image of the ring galaxy NGC 660, obtained with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph
  on the Fredrick C. Gillett Gemini North telescope was obtained in August of 2012.
  The image is made from three images taken through g, r, i, and hydrogen alpha filters
  and assigned the colors of blue, green, orange and red respectively in this color
  composite image. The field of view is 9.3x5.6 arcminutes and it is oriented 8 degrees
  clockwise from north at right and east up. The total exposure (integration) time
  is 1,620 seconds for all filters. Color composite produced by Travis Rector, University
  of Alaska Anchorage.'

description: The two galaxies in this image — NGC 672 (top right) and IC 1727 (bottom
  left) — appear to be so close that they are almost elbowing each other, like playful
  children. In fact, the galaxies shown in this beautifully detailed image taken at
  the Kitt Peak National Observatory, a program of NSF’s NOIRLab, are classified as
  a galactic pair, and the gravity of each galaxy influences the other. The pair are
  located around 20 million light-years away from Earth and the space between them
  spans over 80,000 light-years, a seemingly enormous gap. However, from the perspective
  of the galaxies’ themselves, that separation is not so significant, as it is roughly
  equivalent to the size of the galaxies themselves.

  The colors illustrate the excitation levels and abundance patterns in the galaxy&#x27;s

description: This image of Supernova 2002ic was taken at the Swope 1-meter telescope
  at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile on January 7, 2003. The supernova is the bright
  point of light in the center, at the intersection of two background galaxies. The
  host galaxy of the supernova is extremely faint and is not visible. A strong signal
  of hydrogen was detected in ground-based spectroscopic observations of the supernova,
  leading a team of astronomers in Chile and the U.S. to conclude that the source
  of this Type Ia supernova consisted of a white dwarf that suddenly exploded after
  gaining hydrogen gas blown off by its gravitational partner, a common asymptotic
  giant branch (AGB) star three to seven times as massive as the Sun. This is the
  first unambiguous detection of the progenitor of a Type Ia supernova. Four spectroscopic
  observations of SN2002ic were made using the Baade 6.5-meter and 2.5-meter Dupont
  telescopes at Las Campanas between November 2002 and January 2003.

  This image shows unusual structures around NGC 474 characterized as tidal tails

description: The irregular dwarf galaxy IC 1613 contains some 100 million stars and
  is a member of our Local Group of galaxies, which also includes our Milky Way, the
  Andromeda spiral galaxy, and the Magellanic Clouds. It is at a distance of 2.4 million
  light-years and contains several examples of Cepheid variable stars — key calibrators
  of the cosmic distance ladder. The bulk of its stars were formed about 7 billion
  years ago and it does not appear to be undergoing star formation at the present
  day, unlike other very active dwarf irregulars such as the Large and Small Magellanic
  clouds. To the lower right of IC 1613, one may view a background galaxy cluster
  (several hundred times more distant than IC 1613) consisting of dozens of orange-yellow
  blobs, centered on a pair of giant cluster elliptical galaxies. To the left of the
  irregular galaxy is a bright, sixth magnitude, foreground, Milky Way star in the
  constellation of Cetus the Whale, identified here as a star by its sharp diffraction
  spikes radiating at 45-degree angles.  This image is an excerpt from the Dark Energy
  Survey, which has released a massive, public collection of astronomical data and
  calibrated images from six years of work. The Dark Energy Survey is a global collaboration
  that includes the Department of Energy&#x27;s (DOE) Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory
  (Fermilab), the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), and NSF’s
  NOIRLab. The image was taken with the Dark Energy Camera, fabricated by DOE, on
  the Víctor M. Blanco 4-meter Telescope. The immensity and depth of the survey can
  be appreciated by diving into the zoomable version of this wider excerpt.
