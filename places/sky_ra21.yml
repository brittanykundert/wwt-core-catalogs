description: The galaxy ESO 342-G017 was observed on August 19, 1998 during a spell
  of excellent observing conditions. Two exposures, each lasting 120 seconds, were
  taken through a red filtre to produce this photo. The quality of the original images
  is excellent, with seeing (FWHM) of only 0.26 arcsec measured on the stars in the
  frame.  ESO 342-G017 is an Sc-type spiral galaxy seen edge-on, and the Test Camera
  was rotated so that the disc of the galaxy appears horizontal in the figure. Thanks
  to the image quality, the photo shows much detail in the rather flat disc, including
  a very thin, obscuring dust band and some brighter knots, most probably star-forming
  regions.This image is reproduced from a composite of two 120-second exposures in
  the red R-band (~600 nm) of the edge-on galaxy ESO342-G017, both with 0.26 arcsec
  image quality. The frames were flat-fielded and cleaned for cosmics before combination.
  The field shown measures 1.5 x 1.5 arcmin. North is inclined 38 o clockwise from
  the top, East is to the left.

description: IC 5148 is a beautiful planetary nebula located some 3000 light-years
  away in the constellation of Grus (The Crane). The nebula has a diameter of a couple
  of light-years, and it is still growing at over 50 kilometres per second — one of
  the fastest expanding planetary nebulae known. The term “planetary nebula” arose
  in the 19th century, when the first observations of such objects — through the small
  telescopes available at the time — looked somewhat like giant planets. However,
  the true nature of planetary nebulae is quite different. When a star with a mass
  similar to or a few times more than that of our Sun approaches the end of its life,
  its outer layers are thrown off into space. The expanding gas is illuminated by
  the hot remaining core of the star at the centre, forming the planetary nebula,
  which often takes on a beautiful, glowing shape.  When observed with a smaller amateur
  telescope, this particular planetary nebula shows up as a ring of material, with
  the star — which will cool to become a white dwarf — shining in the middle of the
  central hole. This appearance led astronomers to nickname IC 5148 the Spare Tyre
  Nebula. The ESO Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (EFOSC2) on the New Technology
  Telescope at La Silla gives a somewhat more elegant view of this object. Rather
  than looking like a spare tyre, the nebula resembles ethereal blossom with layered
  petals.

description: 'Approximately 95 million light-years away, in the southern constellation
  of Octans (The Octant), lies NGC 7098 — an intriguing spiral galaxy with numerous
  sets of double features. The first of NGC 7098’s double features is a duo of distinct
  ring-like structures that loop around the galaxy’s hazy heart. These are NGC 7098’s
  spiral arms, which have wound themselves around the galaxy’s luminous core. This
  central region hosts a second double feature: a double bar. NGC 7098 has also developed
  features known as ansae, visible as small, bright streaks at each end of the central
  region. Ansae are visible areas of overdensity — they commonly take looping, linear,
  or circular shapes, and can be found at the extremities of planetary ring systems,
  in nebulous clouds, and, as is the case with NGC 7098, in parts of galaxies that
  are packed to the brim with stars. This image is formed from data gathered by the
  FOcal Reducer and low dispersion Spectrograph (FORS) instrument, installed on ESO’s
  Very Large Telescope at Paranal Observatory. An array of distant galaxies are also
  visible throughout the frame, the most prominent being the small, edge-on, spiral
  galaxy visible to the left of NGC 7098, known as PGC 246235.'

  further star formation. To the right somewhat below center in this image, those
  of you with good eyesight, clear screens, and a good dose of wishful thinking, should

  103. In fact, this complex region contains several HH objects, of which HH103 is
  the brightest and the only one visible in this relatively shallow picture. HH objects
  are formed when the energetic outflow from a young stellar object (on its way to
  becoming a full-fledged star) ionizes a slightly denser part of the interstellar
  medium, which then glows in the red light of H-alpha, given off as the hydrogen
  recombines. This energetic region also includes several molecular masers. This picture

description: This image was obtained with the wide-field view of the Mosaic Camera
  on the Mayall 4-meter telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory on August 29th,
  2009. NGC 7023, also known as the Iris Nebula because of its flower-like shape,
  is a bright reflection nebula. The bluish glow of the nebula comes from a hot, massive
  star at the center of the nebula, named HD 200775. Blue light from the star is scattered
  off dust grains in the nebula, giving it its distinctive color. The dust can also
  be seen on the outer portions of the nebula, where it has a faint brownish color
  and blocks out stars behind it. It was observed in the filters B (blue), V (green),
  R (orange) and Hydrogen-Alpha (red). The image is rotated 30 degrees CCW from North
  is up, East is to the left.

description: NGC 7129 is a star-forming region and reflection nebula in the constellation
  of Cepheus. It is about 3000 light years away from the Earth. The stars in this
  nebula are very young, only about a million years old. The red blobs above and below
  the nebula are Herbig Haro objects, which are the result of jets of gas streaming
  away from young stars in the nebula.

description: This image was obtained with the wide-field view of the Mosaic Camera

  reflection nebula located in the constellation Cepheus. Sometimes referred to as
  the ghost nebula, its awkward name is its catalog number in Sidney van den Bergh&#x27;s
  catalog of reflection nebulae, published in 1966. Several stars are embedded in
  the nebula. Their light gives it a ghoulish brown color. North is down and East
  is to the right. Imaged August 28, 2009.

  Edward Emerson (E. E.) Barnard (1857-1923), an American astronomer and pioneer of
  astrophotography who began as an amateur comet hunter, earned a degree in mathematics
  and later worked at Lick Observatory and the University of Chicago. He is also the
  namesake of Barnard’s star, the second closest known star system to Earth.

description: This image was obtained with the wide-field view of the Mosaic camera
  on the Mayall 4-meter telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory. IC 1396 is a
  giant emission nebula that is over 3 degrees in diameter. It is illuminated by a
  hot, massive O-type star (HD 206267) near its center. The star is not visible in
  this image- it is off of the top edge. This image is of IC 1396A, a dark, dense
  cloud of gas embedded in the nebula. It is informally known as the “Elephant Trunk
  Nebula” because of its distinctive shape. Images of other parts of IC 1396 are also
  available in this gallery. The image was generated with observations in the Hydrogen
  alpha (red), Sulphur [SII] (blue) and I (orange) filters. In this image, North is
  right, East is up.
