description: The smokey black silhouette in this new image is part of a large, sparse
  cloud of partially ionised hydrogen — an HII region — known as Gum 15. In wide-field
  images this nebula appears as a striking reddish purple clump dotted with stars
  and slashed by opaque, weaving dust lanes. This image homes in on one of these dust
  lanes, showing the central region of the nebula. These dark chunks of sky have seemingly
  few stars because lanes of dusty material are obscuring the bright, glowing regions
  of gas beyond. The occasional stars that do show up in these patches are actually
  between us and Gum 15, but create the illusion that we are peering through a window
  out onto the more distant sky. Gum 15 is shaped by the aggressive winds flowing
  from the stars within and around it. The cloud is located near to several large
  associations of stars including the star cluster ESO 313-13. The brightest member
  of this cluster, named HD 74804, is thought to have ionised Gum 15’s hydrogen cloud.
  This ionised hydrogen content is the cause of the red hue permeating the frame.
  This image was taken as part of the ESO Cosmic Gems programme [1] using the FORS
  instrument on the Very Large Telescope at ESO’s Paranal Observatory in Chile. This
  project has actually produced multiple images of this target — back in July 2014,
  ESO released a stunning wide-field image of Gum 15 with the Wide Field Imager on
  the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope at the La Silla Observatory that showed the nebula’s
  sculpted clouds, murky dust, and brightly shining stars in extraordinary detail.
  The portion of Gum 15 shown in the new and more detailed VLT image can be seen within
  the wider frame towards the top left quarter of the 2.2-metre image. Notes [1] The
  ESO Cosmic Gems programme is an initiative to produce images of interesting, intriguing
  or visually attractive objects using ESO telescopes, for the purposes of education
  and public outreach. The programme makes use of telescope time that cannot be used
  for science observations. All data collected may also be suitable for scientific
  purposes, and are made available to astronomers through ESO’s science archive.

description: This cloud-strewn new image of RCW 36 (or Gum 20) was captured by ESO’s
  Focal Reducer and low dispersion Spectrograph (FORS). It shows one of the sites
  of massive-star formation closest to our Solar System, about 2300 light-years away.
  Located in the constellation of Vela (The Sails), the RCW 36 emission nebula is
  only part of an even larger star formation complex, known as the Vela Molecular
  Ridge. Some areas in the clouds of RCW 36 are dense enough to block out background
  light, creating patches and wisps of inky black. Despite the dark appearance of
  these clouds, they are the only places in the Universe in which star formation occurs;
  clumps of molecular hydrogen and cosmic dust collapse and come together to form
  stars encircled by small families of planets, as in our own Solar System. FORS is
  mounted on ESO’s Very Large Telescope, one of the world&#x27;s most advanced astronomical
  observatories. This image was selected as part of the ESO Cosmic Gems programme,

description: The remarkably thin galaxy IC 2233 is featured in this image from the
  Nicholas U. Mayall 4-meter Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory, a Program
  of NSF’s NOIRLab. IC 2233’s needle-thin profile is due to both its structure and
  its orientation towards Earth. The galaxy’s orientation — known to astronomers as
  inclination — is almost exactly side-on, making this one of the flattest galaxies
  known. The exposure of this particular image is deep and the entire field littered
  with galaxies of various types of inclinations.  As well as lying flat from our
  point of view, IC 2233 also lacks the prominent bulge that fattens the profile of
  spiral galaxies such as Andromeda and the Milky Way.  The wafer-thin profile of
  this celestial needle has been fascinating observers for nearly 150 years — IC 2233
  was first discovered in 1874 by the Welsh amateur astronomer Isaac Roberts, one
  of the pioneers of astrophotography.

description: M67 is an open star cluster in the constellation Cancer. One of the oldest
  known such clusters, M67 was believed to be an amazing 10 billion years old. New
  estimates, however, fall below 4 billion years, still quite old but younger than
  the current winner NGC6791, at 7 billion. M67 contains approximately 500 stars within
  its 12 light-year diameter and is located some 2500 light-years away. This full
  color image was created from nine images taken in the BVR pass-bands at the Burrell
  Schmidt telescope of Case Western Reserve University&#x27;s Warner and Swasey Observatory.
  The Burrell Schmidt is located on Kitt Peak, near Tucson, Arizona. The images were
  taken in January 1997. North is at the top with east to the left.

description: NGC2685 is an interesting polar ring galaxy in the constellation Ursa
  Major. It is also called the Helix Galaxy or the Pancake Galaxy. It has a set of
  unusual whorls, or helical filaments, surrounding the central spindle of a relatively
  normal S0 galaxy, and was called the most unusual galaxy in the Shapley-Ames catalogue.
  Sometimes classified as SB0(pec), NGC2685 is odd enough to appear as number 336
  in Arp&#x27;s Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies.  Polar ring galaxies are dynamically peculiar,
  having a ring of gas, stars and dust orbiting in a plane almost perpendicular to
  the normal flat plane of the host galaxy, that is, they contain two separate velocity
  systems whose axes are perpendicular. The most popular view says that such galaxies
  are the result of an interaction, up to and including a complete merger with another
  galaxy.  NGC2685 also shows weak emission lines in the optical, and none in the
  infrared, making it an atypical member of the class of active galaxies called LINERS.  The
  present picture is a color composite of CCD images from the 0.9-meter telescope
  of the Kitt Peak National Observatory, near Tucson, Arizona, taken in November 1998.  Image
  size 8.5 arc minutes.

  catalogs covering between 4000 and 8000 square degrees of sky in three wavelength
  bands. Dive into survey images and explore the Universe with the survey’s Imagine
  Sky Viewer. DECaLS, which is being carried out on the CTIO Blanco telescope, is
  one of three public surveys that will jointly image 14,000 square degrees of sky
  to provide targets for the upcoming Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument cosmology
  project at the Kitt Peak Mayall telescope.
