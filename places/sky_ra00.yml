description: Robert&#x27;s Quartet is a family of four very different galaxies, located

  constellation of the Phoenix. Its members are NGC 87, NGC 88, NGC 89 and NGC 92,
  discovered by John Herschel in the 1830s. NGC 87 (upper right) is an irregular galaxy
  similar to the satellites of our Milky Way, the Magellanic Clouds. NGC 88 (centre)
  is a spiral galaxy with an external diffuse envelope, most probably composed of
  gas. NGC 89 (lower middle) is another spiral galaxy with two large spiral arms.
  The largest member of the system, NGC 92 (left), is a spiral Sa galaxy with an unusual
  appearance. One of its arms, about 100,000 light-years long, has been distorted
  by interactions and contains a large quantity of dust.

description: Image obtained with ESO&#x27;s Very Large Telescope (VLT) of the spiral
  galaxy observed by the European Commissioner for Science and Research, Janez Potocnik,
  when at Paranal. NGC 134 is a barred spiral with its spiral arms loosely wrapped
  around a bright, bar-shaped central region. The red features lounging along its
  spiral arms are glowing clouds of hot gas in which stars are forming, so-called
  HII regions. The galaxy also shows prominent dark lanes of dust across the disc,
  obscuring part of the galaxy&#x27;s starlight. The image is a colour composite based
  on data obtained in the B, V, R, and H- filters with the FORS2 instrument attached
  to Antu, UT1 of the VLT. During his stay on Paranal, the Commissioner, together
  with the observatory staff, prepared the observations of this Galaxy. At night,
  Janez Potocnik initiated these observations, and checked the quality of the images
  as they appeared on the control screens. Because the high-sensitivity detectors
  used on the VLT measure only the intensity of the light reaching their pixels, the
  colour information is acquired by taking a sequence of images through different
  coloured filters. Consequently, the Commissioner could not immediately see the attached
  image, but only black-and-white version of it. The final colour processing was done
  by Haennes Heyer and Henri Boffin, with input from Yuri Beletsky (all ESO).

description: The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) galaxy is a striking feature of the
  southern sky even to the unaided eye. But visible-light telescopes cannot get a
  really clear view of what is in the galaxy because of obscuring clouds of interstellar
  dust. VISTA’s infrared capabilities have now allowed astronomers to see the myriad
  of stars in this neighbouring galaxy much more clearly than ever before. The result
  is this record-breaking image — the biggest infrared image ever taken of the Small
  Magellanic Cloud — with the whole frame filled with millions of stars. As well as
  the SMC itself this very wide-field image reveals many background galaxies and several
  star clusters, including the very bright 47 Tucanae globular cluster at the right
  of the picture.

description: 'Haro 11 appears to shine gently amid clouds of gas and dust, but this
  placid facade belies the monumental rate of star formation occurring in this “starburst”
  galaxy. By combining data from ESO’s Very Large Telescope and the NASA/ESA Hubble
  Space Telescope, astronomers have created a new image of this incredibly bright
  and distant galaxy. The team of astronomers from Stockholm University, Sweden, and
  the Geneva Observatory, Switzerland, have identified 200 separate clusters of very
  young, massive stars. Most of these are less than 10 million years old. Many of
  the clusters are so bright in infrared light that astronomers suspect that the stars
  are still emerging from the cloudy cocoons where they were born. The observations
  have led the astronomers to conclude that Haro 11 is most likely the result of a
  merger between a galaxy rich in stars and a younger, gas-rich galaxy. Haro 11 is
  found to produce stars at a frantic rate, converting about 20 solar masses of gas
  into stars every year. Haro galaxies, first discovered by the noted astronomer Guillermo
  Haro in 1956, are defined by unusually intense blue and violet light. Usually this
  high energy radiation comes from the presence of many newborn stars or an active
  galactic nucleus. Haro 11 is about 300 million light-years away and is the second
  closest of such starburst galaxies. The paper describing this result (“Super star
  clusters in Haro 11: Properties of a very young starburst and evidence for a near-infrared
  flux excess”, by A. Adamo et al.) is available at  http://adsabs.harvard.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.16983.x'

description: The HAWK-I instrument on ESO&#x27;s Very Large Telescope (VLT) at the
  Paranal Observatory in Chile has been used to great effect in producing this distinctive
  image of the distant galaxy NGC 157. Boasting a central sweep of stars resembling
  a giant &quot;S&quot;, reminiscent of the comic book hero Superman’s symbol, this
  celestial spiral is indeed a super example of how new technology is helping us to
  learn more about the cosmos. HAWK-I stands for High-Acuity Wide-field K-band Imager,
  and it is one of the latest and most powerful instruments on the VLT. It detects
  infrared light, allowing us to peer through the gas and dust that normally obscures
  our view. This reveals an otherwise hidden view of the Universe, and gives astronomers
  the opportunity to study dense areas of star formation. Learning more about star
  formation is an important step towards expanding our understanding of our own origins.
  The same processes that are coalescing material in NGC 157 and creating stars there
  took place around 4.5 billion years ago in the Milky Way to form our own star, the
  Sun. NGC 157 is faint at about magnitude 11, but can be tracked down by dedicated
  amateur astronomers. It is located within the constellation of Cetus (the Sea Monster).

description: 'Can you count the number of bright dots in this picture? This crowded
  frame is a deep-field image obtained using the Wide Field Imager (WFI), a camera
  mounted on a relatively modestly sized telescope, the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre located
  at the La Silla Observatory, Chile. This image is one of five patches of sky covered
  by the COMBO-17 survey (Classifying Objects by Medium-Band Observations in 17 filters),
  a deep search for cosmic objects in a relatively narrow area of the southern hemisphere&#x27;s
  sky. Each one of the five patches is recorded using 17 individual colour filters.
  Each one of the five COMBO-17 images covers an area of the sky the size of the full
  Moon. The survey has already revealed thousands of previously unknown cosmic specimens
  — over 25 000 galaxies, tens of thousands of distant stars and quasars previously
  hidden from our view, showing just how much we still have to learn about the Universe.
  Some of the most distant flecks of light visible in this photo are galaxies whose
  light has been travelling for nine or ten billion years before reaching to us. By
  studying galaxies of different ages astronomers can understand how they evolve in
  time, from mature nearby galaxies similar to our galaxy, the Milky Way, to young
  ones in the distant Universe that reveal what the cosmos was like in its infancy.

description: '&quot;This compelling image from the Gemini North telescope peers into
  the heart of VV 166, a galaxy group 300 million light years distant. It presents,
  at a glance, a sampling of the wide diversity of systems that populate the deep
  reaches of the nearby Universe. One of its most fascinating features is a striking
  alignment of three disparate galaxies in a near equilateral triangle: Spiral-shaped
  NGC 70 at top, elliptical galaxy NGC 68 to its lower right, and lenticular galaxy
  NGC 71 to its lower left. NGC 70’s spiral arms are dominated by extensive areas
  of active star formation which appear blue in this image due to the colors used
  to assemble this color composite. NGC 68 looks monochromatic because it’s a much
  older system devoid of star formation and spiral structure. NGC 71 is a lenticular
  galaxy with attributes of both spiral and elliptical systems. NGC 70’s spiral arms
  also appear distorted between NGC 68 and NGC 71, indicating a possible tidal dance
  with one or more of the group’s galaxies. These graceful interactions are choreographed
  as VV 166’s members whiz collectively through space at about 6,500 kilometers per
  second. Barred spiral galaxy NGC 72 lies to the triangle’s lower left. Our own Milky
  Way galaxy has a similar bar-like structure, but its arms are of a “grand design”—
  more splendid, organized, and numerous. Obtained using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph

description: M110 is the second small companion (along with M32) to our sister galaxy,
  M31, the Andromeda Nebula. It is classified as type E5 or E6, often with the additional
  &quot;p&quot; for peculiar because of the structure clearly visible in this short
  exposure image, which is probably due to dust clouds. Because of its small size,
  it is usually counted as a dwarf spheroidal rather than a normal elliptical. Although
  it was definitely discovered by Messier and sketched by him, it was not included
  in his list (perhaps due to carelessness), and was the last object to be added (in
  1966). The present picture is a color composite of CCD images from the 0.9-meter
  telescope of the Kitt Peak National Observatory, near Tucson, Arizona. A deeper
  exposure showing more of the outer regions of the galaxy appears in this picture
  of all three of M31, M32 and M110.

  M31, M33 and our Milky Way are the three largest members of the Local Group of galaxies.
  M31 is a spiral galaxy very similar in size and mass to our own. Ten &#x27;pointings&#x27;
  of the camera along the galaxy in five filters were used to make the image. You
  could line seven full moons across the image. The image was generated with observations
  with the U (violet), B (blue), V (cyan), I (orange) and H-alpha (red) filters. The
  five filters show the star colors and HII star forming regions in vivid detail.
  About 600 million pixels in size, it is the largest and most detailed image of M31
  ever completed that covers the entire galaxy. This image is rotated CW 127 degrees
  from North is up, East to the left.

description: This image was obtained with the wide-field view of the Mosaic camera
  on the WIYN 0.9m-meter telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory. NGC 206 is a
  massive star-forming region (also known as an “OB association”) embedded in the
  Andromeda Galaxy (M31). It is clearly visible in the center to upper-left corner
  of the image. It is estimated to have a mass about 200,000 times that of our Sun.
  Its distinctive bluish color is from very young hot, massive stars in the cluster.
  The presence of these massive stars indicate that the cluster is less than 10 million
  years old, which is very young for stars. The red nebulae in the galaxies are locations
  in M31 where star formation is currently underway. The image was generated with
  observations in the B (blue), V (green) and Hydrogen-Alpha (red) filters. In this
  image, North is down, East is right.

description: This image of spiral galaxy NGC253 was taken with the National Science

  in Chile.  NGC253 is the brightest member of the Sculptor group of galaxies, which
  is grouped around the south galactic pole (and therefore is sometimes named “South
  Polar Group”). The Sculptor group may be the next closest group of galaxies beyond
  our Local Group, located about 8 million light-years from Earth.  NGC253 is considered
  a starburst galaxy, where stars form and explode at an unusually high rate. NGC253
  is one of the brightest galaxies beyond the Local Group; it is also referred to
  as the Sculptor Galaxy  NGC253 was also one of the major discoveries of Caroline
  Herschel, the sister of William Herschel, who discovered the object on September
  23, 1783.

  The two red streaks near the middle of DESI-010.8534-20.6214 are the gravitationally
  lensed arcs (“straight” arcs) — highly magnified and stretched images — of background
  galaxies. The gravitational lens responsible for this warping is, collectively,
  the two concentrations of orange galaxies above and below the straight arcs.

description: <p>This image of the Cartwheel and its companion galaxies is a composite
  from Webb’s Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), which
  reveals details that are difficult to see in the individual images alone.</p> <p>This
  galaxy formed as the result of a high-speed collision that occurred about 400 million
  years ago. The Cartwheel is composed of two rings, a bright inner ring and a colorful
  outer ring. Both rings expand outward from the center of the collision like shockwaves.</p>
  <p>However, despite the impact, much of the character of the large, spiral galaxy
  that existed before the collision remains, including its rotating arms. This leads
  to the “spokes” that inspired the name of the Cartwheel Galaxy, which are the bright
  red streaks seen between the inner and outer rings. These brilliant red hues, located
  not only throughout the Cartwheel, but also the companion spiral galaxy at the top
  left, are caused by glowing, hydrocarbon-rich dust.</p> <p>In this near- and mid-infrared
  composite image, MIRI data are colored red while NIRCam data are colored blue, orange,
  and yellow. Amidst the red swirls of dust, there are many individual blue dots,
  which represent individual stars or pockets of star formation. NIRCam also defines
  the difference between the older star populations and dense dust in the core and
  the younger star populations outside of it.</p> <p>Webb’s observations capture the
  Cartwheel in a very transitory stage. The form that the Cartwheel Galaxy will eventually
  take, given these two competing forces, is still a mystery. However, this snapshot
  provides perspective on what happened to the galaxy in the past and what it will
  do in the future.</p>
