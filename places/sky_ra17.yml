description: The centre of our Milky Way galaxy is located in the southern constellation
  Sagittarius (The Archer) and is &quot;only&quot; 26,000 light-years away. On high-resolution
  images, it is possible to discern thousands of individual stars within the central,
  one light-year wide region. Using the motions of these stars to probe the gravitational
  field, observations over the last decade have shown that a mass of about 3 million
  times that of the Sun is concentrated within a radius of only 10 light-days of the
  compact radio and X-ray source SgrA* (Sagittarius A) at the centre of the star cluster. This
  means that SgrA* is the most likely counterpart of the black hole believed to exist
  at the centre of our Galaxy. This image was obtained in mid-2002 with the NACO instrument
  at the 8.2-m VLT Yepun telescope. It combines frames in three infrared wavebands
  between 1.6 and 3.5 µm. The compact objects are stars and their colours indicate
  their temperature (blue =&quot;hot&quot;, red =&quot;cool&quot;). There is also
  diffuse infrared emission from interstellar dust between the stars. A newer image
  of that region has been published in 2008; see image eso0846a.

  and wonderful 340-million-pixel vista of the central parts of our galactic home,
  a 34 by 20-degree wide image that provides us with a view as experienced by amateur
  astronomers around the world. Taken by Stéphane Guisard, an ESO engineer and world-renowned
  astrophotographer, from Cerro Paranal, home of ESO’s Very Large Telescope, this
  second image directly benefits from the quality of Paranal’s sky, one of the best
  on the planet. The image shows the region spanning the sky from the constellation
  of Sagittarius (the Archer) to Scorpius (the Scorpion). The very colourful Rho Ophiuchi
  and Antares region features prominently to the right, as well as much darker areas,
  such as the Pipe and Snake Nebulae. The dusty lane of our Milky Way runs obliquely
  through the image, dotted with remarkable bright, reddish nebulae, such as the Lagoon
  and the Trifid Nebulae, as well as NGC 6357 and NGC 6334. This dark lane also hosts
  the very centre of our Galaxy, where a supermassive black hole is lurking. The image
  was obtained by observing with a 10-cm Takahashi FSQ106Ed f/3.6 telescope and a
  SBIG STL CCD camera, using a NJP160 mount. Images were collected through three different
  filters (B, V and R) and then stitched together. This mosaic was assembled from
  52 different sky fields made from about 1200 individual images totalling 200 hours
  exposure time, with the final image having a size of 24 403 x 13 973 pixels. Note
  that the final, full resolution image is only available through Stéphane Guisard.

  different filters (blue and red), which were taken 7 years apart. Because the star
  is very close to the Earth, it has a large apparent motion on the sky, and so has
  moved in between the 7 years. This is why the star appears as a double coloured

  at 2150 nanometres, in red), to cover the near infrared region of the electromagnetic

description: This splendid colour image of a famous southern Planetary Nebula, NGC
  6302 or the Bug Nebula (sometimes nicknames the Butterfly Nebula), was obtained
  by combining blue, yellow and red images obtained on May 22, 1998, with 10 minute
  exposures and an image quality better than 0.6 arcseconds. Towards the end of their
  life, some massive stars expand to giant dimensions. They shed most of the hydrogen
  in their outer layers as a strong &quot;stellar wind&quot;, before they contract
  towards a final compact stage as &quot;white dwarfs&quot;. After this ejection process,
  the star remains thousands of times brighter and also much hotter than the Sun during
  a few thousand years. Its strong ultraviolet radiation has the effect of ionizing
  the previously ejected gas, which then shines before it disperses into interstellar
  space. The resulting nebulae (traditionally referred to as Planetary Nebulae , because
  of their resemblance to a planet in a small telescope) often exhibit very complex
  morphologies. The Butterfly Nebula belongs to the class of bipolar nebulae, as this
  picture clearly illustrates. A dark, dusty and disc-like structure - seen edge-on
  in this image - obscures the central star from our view. However, its strong radiation
  escapes perpendicular to the disk and heats and illuminates the material deposited
  there by the stellar wind. The origin of the dark disk may be due to the central
  star being a member of a double star system. This has been shown to be the case
  in some other bipolar nebulae in which, contrary to the Butterfly Nebula, there
  is a direct view towards the star.

description: This photograph shows an unusual sky field in the Milky Way band. It
  is centred on one of the classical, dark globules, known as Barnard 68 (B68) after
  the American astronomer, Edward E. Barnard (1857 - 1923), who included it in a list
  of such objects, published in 1919. It appears as a compact, opaque and rather sharply
  defined object against a rich, background star field. Even on this image that registers
  many faint stars in the area, not a single foreground star is observed. This is
  a clear sign that this globule must be relatively nearby.  Interstellar clouds consist
  of gas and dust, including many molecules, some of which contain carbon atoms (i.e.
  organic). For a long time considered to be &quot;holes in the sky&quot;, molecular
  clouds are now known to be among the coolest objects in the Universe (the temperature
  is approx. 10 K, or -263 °C). Moreover, and most importantly, they are nurseries
  of stars and planets.  It still remains a mystery how a dark cloud like Barnard
  68 at some moment begins to contract and subsequently transforms itself into hydrogen-burning
  stars. However, deep images of these clouds, such as this one obtained by FORS1
  on VLT ANTU, may provide important clues. This small cloud seems to be in its very
  earliest phase of collapse. It has a diameter of only 7 light-months (approx. 0.2
  pc) and it is located at a distance of about 500 light-years (160 pc) towards the
  southern constellation Ophiuchus (The Serpent-holder).  This three-colour composite
  was reproduced from one blue (B), one green-yellow (V) and one near-infrared (I)
  exposure that were obtained with VLT ANTU and FORS1 in the early morning of March
  27, 1999. The field measures 6.8x6.8 arcmin 2. The image consists of 2048x2048 pixels,
  each measuring 0.20 arcsec; the &quot;Full Resolution&quot; version of the photo
  shows all of these. North is up and East is to the left. (See also ESO Press Release

description: The centre of our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is again in the sights of
  ESO telescopes. This time it’s the turn of ISAAC, the VLT’s near- and mid-infrared
  spectrometer and camera. From Chile’s Atacama Desert, site of the ESO observatories,
  the Milky Way offers magnificent views, particularly in the southern hemisphere
  winter, when the central region of our galaxy is most visible (see eso0934). However,
  the Galactic Centre itself, located about  27 000 light-years away in the constellation
  of Sagittarius, hides behind thick clouds of interstellar dust, which appear as
  dark obscuring lanes in visible light, but which are transparent at longer wavelengths
  such as the infrared. In this image, the infrared observations clearly reveal the
  dense clustering of stars in the galactic core. ESO telescopes have been tracking
  stars orbiting the centre of the Milky Way for more than 18 years, getting the highest
  resolution images of this area and providing a definitive proof of the existence
  of a supermassive black hole in the heart of our galaxy (read more in eso0226 and
  eso0846). Infrared flashes emitted by hot gas falling into the supermassive black
  hole have also been detected with ESO telescopes (see eso0330). This representative-colour
  picture is composed of images taken by ISAAC at near-infrared wavelengths through
  2.25, 2.09, and 1.71 µm narrowband filters (shown in red, green and blue respectively).

description: 'The Cat’s Paw Nebula is revisited in a combination of exposures from
  the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope and expert amateur astronomers Robert Gendler and
  Ryan M. Hannahoe. The distinctive shape of the nebula is revealed in reddish puffy
  clouds of glowing gas against a dark sky dotted with stars. The image was made by
  combining existing observations from the 2.2-metre MPG/ESO telescope of the La Silla
  Observatory in Chile (see ESO Photo Release eso1003) with 60 hours of exposures
  on a 0.4-metre telescope taken by Gendler and Hannahoe. The resolution of the existing
  2.2-metre MPG/ESO telescope observations was combined (by using their “luminance”
  or brightness) with the colour information from Gendler and Hannahoe’s observations
  to produce a beautiful combination of data from amateur and professional telescopes.
  For example, the additional colour information brings out the faint blue nebulosity
  in the central region, which is not seen in the original ESO image, while the ESO
  data contribute their finer detail. The result is an image that is much more than
  the sum of its parts. The well-named Cat’s Paw Nebula (also known as NGC 6334) lies
  in the constellation of Scorpius (The Scorpion). Although it appears close to the
  centre of the Milky Way on the sky, it is relatively near to Earth, at a distance
  of about 5500 light-years. It is about 50 light-years across and is one of the most
  active star formation regions in our galaxy, containing massive, young brilliant
  blue stars, which have formed in the last few million years. It is host to possibly
  tens of thousands of stars in total, some of them visible and others still hidden
  in the clouds of gas and dust. Links  Robert Gendler’s website '

description: This  image, captured by ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) at Paranal,
  shows a  small part of the well-known emission nebula, NGC 6357, located some  8000
  light-years away, in the tail of the southern constellation of  Scorpius (The Scorpion).
  The image glows with the characteristic red of  an H II region, and contains a large
  amount of ionised and excited  hydrogen gas. The  cloud is bathed in intense ultraviolet
  radiation — mainly from the open  star cluster Pismis 24, home to some massive,
  young, blue stars — which  it re-emits as visible light, in this distinctive red
  hue. The  cluster itself is out of the field of view of this picture, its diffuse  light
  seen illuminating the cloud on the centre-right of the image. We  are looking at
  a close-up of the surrounding nebula, showing a mesh of  gas, dark dust, and newly
  born and still forming stars.

description: 'This new image, from ESO’s VISTA telescope, shows a newly-discovered
  brown dwarf nicknamed VVV BD001, which is located at the very centre of this zoomable image.
  It is the first new brown dwarf spotted in our cosmic neighbourhood as part of the
  VVV Survey. VVV BD001 is located about 55 light-years away from us, towards the
  very crowded centre of our galaxy. Brown dwarfs are stars that never quite managed
  to grow up into a star like our Sun. They are often referred to as “failed stars”;
  they are larger in size than planets like Jupiter, but smaller than stars. This
  dwarf is peculiar in two ways; firstly, it is the first one found towards the centre
  of our Milky Way, one of the most crowded regions of the sky. Secondly, it belongs
  to an unusual class of stars known as “unusually blue brown dwarfs” — it is still
  unclear why these stars are bluer than expected. Brown dwarfs are born in the same
  way as stars, but do not have enough mass to trigger the burning of hydrogen to
  become normal stars. Because of this they are much cooler and produce far less light,
  making them harder to find. Astronomers generally look for these objects using near
  and mid-infrared cameras and special telescopes that are sensitive to these very
  cool objects, but usually avoid looking in very crowded regions of space — such
  as the central region of our galaxy, for example. VISTA (the Visible and Infrared
  Survey Telescope for Astronomy) is the world’s largest survey telescope and is located
  at ESO’s Paranal Observatory in Chile. It is performing six separate surveys of
  the sky, and the VVV (VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea) survey is designed to catalogue
  a billion objects in the centre of our own Milky Way galaxy. VVV BD001 was discovered
  by chance during this survey. Scientists have used the VVV catalogue to create a
  3 dimensional map of the central bulge of the Milky Way (eso1339). The data have
  also been used to create a monumental 108 200 by 81 500 pixel colour image containing
  nearly nine billion pixels (eso1242), one of the biggest astronomical images ever
  produced. Links  VVV Survey (VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea) Research Paper '

description: This image shows the bright centre and swirling arms of the spiral galaxy
  NGC 6300. NGC 6300 is located in a starry patch of sky in the southern constellation
  of Ara (The Altar) which contains a variety of intriguing deep-sky objects. NGC
  6300 has beautiful pinwheeling arms connected by a straight bar that cuts through
  the middle of the galaxy. While it may look like a standard spiral galaxy in visible-light
  images like this one, it is actually a Seyfert II galaxy. Such galaxies have unusually
  luminous centres that emit very energetic radiation, meaning that they are often
  intensely bright in part of the spectrum either side of the visible. NGC 6300 is
  thought to contain a massive black hole at its heart some 300 000 times more massive
  than the Sun. This black hole is emitting high energy X-rays as it is fed by the
  material that is pulled into it. This image of NGC 6300 was taken by the ESO Faint
  Object Spectrograph and Camera (EFOSC2) on the 3.58-metre New Technology Telescope
  (NTT). The NTT is based at ESO’s La Silla observing site, on the outskirts of the
  Atacama Desert in Chile, and was inaugurated in 1989. A black and white image of
  NGC 6300 was released at the time of the telescope’s inauguration — one of 31 images
  that were the first to be released from the NTT.

description: Rather than showing spectacular objects, some of the most surprising
  images of the Universe instead focus on emptiness. This new image from the 2.2-metre
  MPG/ESO telescope shows dark tentacles swirling outwards from a dark, blank spot
  of space in the centre of the frame, particularly conspicuous against the dense
  peppering of bright gold and red stars across the rest of the image. This region
  is not a hole in the cosmos, or an empty patch of sky. The dark lanes are actually
  made up of thick, opaque dust lying between us and the packed star field behind
  it. This obscuring dust forms part of a dark molecular cloud, cold and dense areas
  where large quantities of dust and molecular gas mingle and block the visible light
  emitted by more distant stars. It is still unclear how these clouds form, but they
  are thought to be the very early stages of new star formation — in the future, the
  subject of this image may well collapse inwards on itself to form a new star system.
  Although the cloud in this image is a fairly anonymous resident of the nearby Universe
  — catalogued as LDN1774 — one of the most famous examples of a molecular cloud is
  the very similar Barnard 68, which lies some 500 light-years away from us. Barnard
  68 has been observed extensively using ESO telescopes, both in visible (eso9924a)
  and infrared light (eso9934, eso0102a). As shown in these different images, it is
  possible to probe through dark cosmic dust using infrared light, but visible-light
  observations such as those shown in this VLT image cannot see beyond the smokescreen.
  This image was taken by the Wide Field Imager, an instrument mounted on ESO’s 2.2-metre
  MPG/ESO telescope at La Silla, Chile.

description: The bright star in the centre of this image is not the star of this show.
  At the bottom centre is a rather unremarkable smudge of red which is in fact a rare
  and valuable object. First discovered by amateur Japanese astronomer, Yukio Sakurai,
  in 1996, and noted as a nova-like object, Sakurai’s discovery turned out to be far
  more interesting than the supernova he initially supposed it to be. The object is
  actually a small white dwarf star undergoing a helium flash — one of only a handful
  of examples of such an event ever witnessed by astronomers. Normally, the white
  dwarf stage is the last in the life cycle of a low-mass star. In some cases, however,
  the star reignites in a helium flash and expands to return to a red giant state,
  ejecting huge amounts of gas and dust in the process, before once again shrinking
  to become a white dwarf. It is a dramatic and short-lived series of events, and
  Sakurai’s Object has allowed astronomers a very rare opportunity to study the events
  in real time. The white dwarf emits sufficient ultraviolet radiation to illuminate
  the gas it has expelled, which can just be seen in this image as the ring of red
  material. This image was taken using the FORS instrument, mounted on ESO’s Very
  Large Telescope.

description: The dark patch snaking across this spectacular image of a field of stars
  in the constellation of Ophiuchus (The Serpent-bearer) is not quite what it appears
  to be. Although it looks as if there are no stars here, they are hidden behind this
  dense cloud of dust that blocks out their light. This particular dark cloud is known
  as LDN 1768. Despite their rather dull appearance, dark nebulae like LDN 1768 are
  of huge interest to astronomers, as it is here that new stars form. Inside these
  vast stellar nurseries there are protostars — stars at the earliest stage of their
  lives, still coalescing out of the gas and dust in the cloud. Protostars are relatively
  cold and have not yet begun to produce enough energy to emit visible light. Instead,
  they emit radiation at submillimetre wavelengths, which human eyes cannot see. Luckily,
  unlike visible light, light at submillimetre wavelengths is not absorbed by the
  surrounding dust. By using special telescopes that are sensitive to submillimetre
  radiation, like the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observatory,
  we can see through the dust and find out more about the protostars within the cloud.
  Eventually, the protostars will become dense and hot enough to start the nuclear
  reactions that will produce visible light and they will start to shine. When this
  happens, they will blow away the cocoon of dust surrounding them and cause any remaining
  gas to emit light as well, creating the spectacular light show known as an HII region.

description: Our Solar System formed out of a huge, primordial cloud of gas and dust.
  The vast majority of that cloud formed the Sun, while the leftover disc of rotating
  material around it eventually coalesced into the orbiting planets we know — and
  live on — today. Astronomers can observe similar processes happening around other
  stars in the cosmos. This splendid Picture of the Week shows a disc of rotating,
  leftover material surrounding the young star HD 163296. Using the observing power
  of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile, astronomers
  have been able to discern specific features in the disc, including concentric rings
  of material surrounding the central star. They were even able to use ALMA to obtain
  high-resolution measurements of the gas and dust constituents of the disc. With
  these data they could infer key details of the formation history of this young stellar
  system. The three gaps between the rings are likely due to a depletion of dust and
  in the middle and outer gaps astronomers also found a lower level of gas. The depletion
  of both dust and gas suggests the presence of newly formed planets, each around
  the mass of Saturn, carving out these gaps on their brand new orbits.

description: This image, taken by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array

  this star-forming cloud in the Cat’s Paw Nebula (NGC 6334) with both ALMA and the
  Submillimeter Array (SMA) in Hawaii astronomers could see that something dramatic
  had taken place, completely changing a stellar nursery over a surprisingly short
  period of time. It is known that young stars form inside protoclusters when pockets
  of gas become so dense that they begin to collapse under their own gravity. Over
  time, discs of dust and gas form around these nascent stars and funnel material
  onto their surfaces helping them grow. However, this new image from ALMA shows a
  massive protostar, nestled deep within this dust-filled stellar nursery, that is
  undergoing an intense growth spurt, most likely triggered by an avalanche of gas
  falling onto its surface. This new material feeding it is causing the protostar
  to shine nearly 100 times brighter than before.The discovery of this outburst supports
  the theory that young stars can undergo intense growth spurts that reshape their
  surroundings.

description: This image from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)
  shows the area surrounding Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole that lurks
  at the centre of the Milky Way — highlighted here with a small circle. New research
  has revealed exciting evidence of interstellar gas and dust orbiting the black hole
  at high speeds. The molecular-hydrogen-rich gas clouds which have been identified
  are known as molecular cloudlets, and they have never before been unambiguously
  detected. This image actually shows the distribution of molecules including carbon
  monoxide, the cloudlets’ second most abundant molecular component. The cloudlets
  lie 26 000 light-years away from us, orbiting fast and relatively close to the black
  hole, at a distance of about one light year. ALMA’s high resolution allowed scientists
  to detect the cloudlets, which are the products of pre-existing massive clouds rotating
  around the centre of our galaxy. These clouds were tidally disrupted into dense
  fragments and a lower density, short-lived component. The latter was identified
  thanks to the signs left by the passage of the synchrotron radiation emitted by
  Sagittarius A* through diffuse gas between the cloudlets. Although clouds of molecular
  gas have the potential to form new stars, these cloudlets are unlikely to create
  stellar newborns. They have a comparatively small mass of around 60 times that of
  the Sun, and exist close to the huge, turbulent, punishing gravitational forces
  exerted by Sagittarius A*. While the stars orbiting Sagittarius A* have been systematically
  observed, these dense molecular cloudlets have not been detected so close to the
  centre of our galaxy before.

description: 'This is a combination of several exposures taken on the night of June
  22nd 1995 (UT of observation 23/06/95:06:18 to 09:34) with a CCD detector on loan
  from Morley Block and the manufacturer, Scientific Imaging Technologies (SITe),
  Inc. This was one of the first of their new 2048x4096, 15 micron, three side buttable,
  thinned, back-illuminated devices, quickly inserted into a Kitt Peak standard dewar
  and installed on the WIYN 3.5m telescope. Three exposures were taken through each
  of three different filters approximating red (five minutes each), blue (fifteen
  minutes each), and green (ten minutes each). The result is therefore a combination
  of an hour and a half of observations. The individual colors were aligned and combined
  in the computer to create this (approximately) true color picture. The pixel size
  on the sky is 0.139 arc seconds; after combination, the final size is 1900x3960,
  or about 4.4x9.2 arc minutes. The image quality was changing during the exposure
  sequence, and to make the final picture the &quot;seeing&quot; measurement (average
  full-width half-maximum (FWHM) for several stars) had to be matched across all nine
  of the original frames, for a final value of about 1.0 arc seconds, although the
  best single frame measured at 0.7 arc seconds. Orientation: N to the right, E up.
  About this object This interesting interacting spiral/elliptical pair of galaxies
  was first described in the Catalogue of Peculiar Galaxies, compiled by Halton Arp
  in 1966. It is also pair number 508 in Igor Karachentsev&#x27;s catalog of binary
  galaxies. The large spiral galaxy (type SABb pec) shows long blue tidal tails caused
  by its interaction with the southerly elliptical. In fact, this &quot;elliptical&quot;
  is much the more interesting galaxy, despite its more nondescript appearance. It
  is a broad line radio galaxy with an unresolved core and a sub-parsec VLBI component
  at 6cm. It is also an intermediate type Seyfert, meaning it has an active nucleus,
  and it shows a double-peaked emission line profile (separation about 5000 km/s),
  which is considered to be strong evidence for the presence of an accretion disk,
  probably around a central supermassive black hole. In this picture we also see the
  presence of numerous more distant background galaxies, showing as clusters of small,
  diffuse red objects and scattered diffuse blue objects. These objects are very difficult
  to detect and require excellent conditions and superb optics. Location: 17 18 00
  +49 04 (1950.0), constellation of Hercules (just!). Distance: approximately 320
  million light-years.'

description: M19 is a globular cluster in the constellation of Ophiuchus, located
  about nine degrees above (north) of the galactic plane and slightly west of the
  line of sight from Earth to the galactic center. It&#x27;s actually on the opposite
  side of the galactic center from Earth, so despite being over 28000 light-years
  from Earth, M19 is one of the Messier globulars closest to the center of the Milky
  Way, at a little more than 5000 light-years. M19 is moving away from us at a rate
  of 146 kilometers per second. M19 is a rich, fairly dense globular cluster, and
  one of the most elongated. The distance along its major axis is around 65 light-years.
  The brightest stars have an average magnitude of 14.8, and although its total absolute
  magnitude is -9, the apparent magnitude to us is 6.8. This is bright enough for
  easy viewing through binoculars and small telescopes. Because of its location near
  the plane and central region of the Milky Way, it has a background of faint dust
  and appears embedded in a rich field of stars. As with other globular clusters,
  which are the oldest, densest, and most populous star clusters in the Milky Way,
  M19 is made up of stars that are all the same age. These are amongst the oldest
  stars in our Galaxy, at an age of about 13 billion years. Because the stars in a
  globular cluster are all the same age and all at the same distance from Earth, they
  provide an excellent laboratory in which astronomers can study stellar evolution.
  The stars of a globular cluster can also be used to understand &quot;standard candles&quot;,
  which is to say, types of stars that all have the same intrinsic brightness, and
  can therefore be used to measure distances. One such type is RR-Lyrae variables,
  only four of which are observed in M19. This picture was created from six images
  taken in July 1997 at the KPNO 0.9-meter telescope during the summer Research Experiences
  for Undergraduates (REU) program operated at the Kitt Peak National Observatory
  and supported by the National Science Foundation. Image size 15.9x15.5 arc minutes.

description: M7 is an open star cluster in the constellation Scorpius, set against

  an interesting contrast with its near neighbor M6. M7 was known as early as the
  year 130 AD (or 130 CE), when it was mentioned by Ptolemy. At its (uncertain) distance
  of 800 light-years, M7&#x27;s 80-odd stars spread over some 20 light-years and are
  in excess of 200 million years old. Recent work suggests a distance of 1000 light-years,
  which increases the size to 25 light-years but does not affect the age. This color

  center for alignment evaluation, Webb's optics and NIRCam are so sensitive that
  the galaxies and stars seen in the background show up. At this stage of Webb’s mirror
  alignment, known as “fine phasing,” each of the primary mirror segments have been
  adjusted to produce one unified image of the same star using only the NIRCam instrument.
  This image of the star, which is called 2MASS J17554042+6551277, uses a red filter
  to optimize visual contrast. | Astrometric solution by Gabe Brammer.
