description: 'This is a near-infrared, colour-coded composite image of a sky field
  in the south-western part of the galactic star-forming region Messier 17. In this
  image, young and heavily obscured stars are recognized by their red colour. Bluer
  objects are either foreground stars or well-developed massive stars whose intense
  light ionizes the hydrogen in this region. The diffuse light that is visible nearly
  everywhere in the photo is due to emission from hydrogen atoms that have (re-)combined
  from protons and electrons. The dark areas are due to obscuration of the light from
  background objects by large amounts of dust — this effect also causes many of those
  stars to appear quite red. A cluster of young stars in the upper-left part of the
  photo, so deeply embedded in the nebula that it is invisible in optical light, is
  well visible in this infrared image. Technical information : The exposures were
  made through three filtres, J (at wavelength 1.25 µm; exposure time 5 min; here
  rendered as blue), H (1.65 µm; 5 min; green) and Ks (2.2 µm; 5 min; red); an additional
  15 min was spent on separate sky frames. The seeing was 0.5 - 0.6 arcsec. The objects
  in the uppermost left corner area appear somewhat elongated because of a colour-dependent
  aberration introduced at the edge by the large-field optics. The sky field shown
  measures approx. 5 x 5 arcmin 2 (corresponding to about 3% of the full moon). North
  is up and East is left.'

description: 'Messier 16 (M16), also known as the Eagle Nebula, is located in the
  southern constellation of Serpens (the Snake). Using the infrared multi-mode ISAAC
  instrument on the 8.2-m VLT ANTU telescope, European astronomers were able to image
  the Eagle Nebula at near-infrared wavelength.  The ISAAC near-infrared images cover
  a 9 x 9 arcminutes region, in three broad-band colours and with sufficient sensitivity
  to detect young stars of all masses and — most importantly — with an image sharpness
  as good as 0.35 arcseconds. The wide-field view of M16 shows that there is much
  happening in the region. The first impression one gets is of an enormous number
  of stars. Those which are blue in the infrared image are either members of the young
  NGC 6611 cluster — whose massive stars are concentrated in the upper right (north
  west) part of the field — or foreground stars which happen to lie along the line
  of sight towards M16. Most of the stars are fainter and more yellow. They are ordinary
  stars behind M16, along the line of sight through the galactic bulge, and are seen
  through the molecular clouds out of which NGC 6611 formed. Some very red stars are
  also seen: these are either very young and embedded in gas and dust clouds, or just
  brighter stars in the background shining through them. This photo is the result
  of a three-colour composite mosaic image of the Eagle Nebula (Messier 16), based
  on 144 individual images obtained with the infrared multi-mode instrument ISAAC
  on the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) at the Paranal Observatory. At the centre,
  the so-called &quot;Pillars of Creation&quot; can be seen. This wide-field infrared
  image shows not only the central three pillars but also several others in the same
  star-forming region, as well as a huge number of stars in front of, in, or behind
  the Eagle Nebula. The cluster of bright blue stars to the upper right is NGC 6611,
  home to the massive and hot stars that illuminate the pillars. Technical information:
  This image was made using the near-infrared camera ISAAC on the ESO 8.2-m VLT ANTU
  telescope on April 8 and May 8 - 10, 2001. The full field measures approximately
  9.1 x 9.1 arcmin, covering roughly 17 x 17 light-years (5.3 x 5.3 pc) at the distance
  to the region (about 6,500 light-years or 2 kpc). This required a 16-position mosaic
  (4 x 4 grid) of ISAAC pointings : at each pointing, a series of images were taken
  in each of the near-infrared J s - (centred at 1.24 µm wavelength), H- (1.65µm),
  and K s - (2.16 µm) bands. North is up and East left.The total integration time
  for each pixel in the mosaic was 1200, 300, and 300 seconds in the central 4.5 x
  4.5 arcmin region, and 200, 50, and 50 seconds in the outer part, in J s -, H-,
  and K s - bands, respectively. The seeing FWHM (full width at half maximum) was
  excellent, at 0.38, 0.36, and 0.33 arcsec in J s, H, and K s, respectively. Point
  sources are detected in the central region at the 3-sigma level (brightest pixel
  above background noise) at 22.6, 21.3, and 20.4 magnitudes in J s, H, and K s, respectively.
  These limits imply that a 1 million year old, 0.075 solar-mass object on the star/brown
  dwarf boundary could be detected in M16 through roughly 15, 20, and 30 magnitudes
  of visual extinction at J s, H, and K s, respectively.After removal of instrumental
  signatures and the bright infrared sky background, all frames in a given band were
  carefully aligned and adjusted to form a seamless mosaic. The three monochromatic
  mosaics were then scaled to the cube root of their intensities to reduce the enormous
  dynamic range and enhance faint nebular features. The mosaics were then combined
  to create the colour-coded image, with the J s -band being rendered as blue, the
  H-band as green, and the K s -band as red. A total of 144 individual 1024 x 1024
  pixel ISAAC images were merged to form this mosaic.   #L'

  The pillars or columns are numbered 1 to 3 from left to right (east to west). The
  pillars themselves are less prominent than on the Hubble visible-light image of
  this region - this because near-infrared light penetrates the thinner parts of the
  gas and dust clouds and only the heads remain opaque. A number of red objects can
  be seen associated with the pillars : some of these are just background sources
  seen through the dust, but some are probably real young stars embedded in the pillars.
  The purple arc near the bottom of the picture is Herbig-Haro object 216, a fast-moving
  clump of heated gas emanating from a young star (see also ESO Press Photo eso0142e).

description: Enlarged view of the head of the largest of the three main pillars, Column
  1. The head is almost transparent around the edges at near-infrared wavelengths,
  but there is still a substantial opaque core which even these near-infrared VLT
  observations cannot penetrate. The complex bluish nebulosity bisected by a dark
  lane near the tip is being lit up by the bright yellow star just below it, which
  appears to be very young and rather massive. Several of the much fainter stars to
  the right of and below this source are found to be associated with EGGs seen in
  the Hubble image, and these all have much lower masses. Finally, there is a faint
  streak of blue light emanating from from the tip of EGG 23, one of the darkest parts
  of Column 1, ending in a blue blob further north. An equal distance to the south
  of the EGG and off the head, there is another curving blue nebulosity. These features
  are also seen in the Hubble image, and may be part of a Herbig-Haro jet coming from
  a young star buried deeply in EGG 23 and invisible in this image. Technical information: The
  region shown measures 1.9 x 2.8 light-years (0.6 x 0.9 pc). The intensity scalings
  have been adjusted to better show the young stars embedded in the head of each column. North

description: Gas and dust condense, beginning the process of creating new stars in
  this image of Messier 8, also known as the Lagoon Nebula. Located four to five thousand
  light-years away, in the constellation of Sagittarius (the Archer), the nebula is
  a giant interstellar cloud, one hundred light-years across. It boasts many large,
  hot stars, whose ultraviolet radiation sculpts the gas and dust into unusual shapes.
  Two of these giant stars illuminate the brightest part of the nebula, known as the
  Hourglass Nebula, a spiralling, funnel-like shape near its centre. Messier 8 is
  one of the few star-forming nebulae visible to the unaided eye, and was discovered
  as long ago as 1747, although the full range of colours wasn’t visible until the
  advent of more powerful telescopes. The Lagoon Nebula derives its name from the
  wide lagoon-shaped dark lane located in the middle of the nebula that divides it
  into two glowing sections. This image combines observations performed through three
  different filters (B, V, R) with the 1.5-metre Danish telescope at the ESO La Silla

description: '  This image depicts the dusty disc encircling the young, isolated star
  HD 169142. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) imaged this disc
  in high resolution by picking up faint signals from its constituent millimetre-sized
  dust grains. The vivid rings are thick bands of dust, separated by deep gaps. Optimised
  to study the cold gas and dust of systems like HD 169142, ALMA’s sharp eyes have
  revealed the structure of many infant solar systems with similar cavities and gaps.
  A variety of theories have been proposed to explain them — such as turbulence caused
  by magnetorotational instability, or the fusing of dust grains — but the most plausible
  explanation is that these pronounced gaps were carved out by giant protoplanets.
  When solar systems form gas and dust coalesce into planets. These planets then effectively
  spring clean their orbits, clearing them of gas and dust and herding the remaining
  material into well-defined bands. The deep gaps seen in this image are consistent
  with the presence of multiple protoplanets — a finding that agrees with other optical
  and infrared studies of the same system. Observing such dusty protoplanetary discs
  with ALMA allows scientists to investigate the first steps of planet formation in
  a bid to unveil the evolutionary paths of these infant systems. Links  INAF press

  Way’s heart than ever before. VISTA was chosen due to its extremely sensitive infrared
  camera, which can see through most of the dust that blocks our view towards the
  centre of the galaxy. What we see in this image is a dense patch of gas and dust  —
  a nebula — that even VISTA’s camera cannot see through. Located near the Lagoon
  Nebula (not seen), it appears to wink back as it mischievously blocks out the light
  from background stars. The full image contains almost nine billion pixels, and is
  part of the Vista Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) survey, a project to image the
  Milky Way’s bulge and disc at near-infrared wavelengths. To create the colour mosaic,
  images at three different wavelengths were seamlessly combined. The full zoomable

description: If you had a brand new state-of-the-art telescope facility, what would
  you look at first? Researchers at the SPECULOOS Southern Observatory — which comprises
  four small telescopes, each with a 1-metre primary mirror — chose to view the Lagoon
  Nebula. This magnificent picture is the result, and is one of the SPECULOOS’ first
  ever observations. The nebula is a cloud of dust and gas in our galaxy where new
  stars are being born, and is found roughly 5000 light-years from us. This striking
  image is made even more impressive by the fact that the SPECULOOS isn’t actually
  designed to study nebulae. The name says it all — SPECULOOS, the Search for habitable
  Planets EClipsing ULtra-cOOl Stars. In other words, the primary mission of this
  telescope facility is to find Earth-like planets orbiting faint nearby stars. The
  candidates it discovers will be passed over to larger telescopes, such as ESO’s
  forthcoming Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), to be studied in more detail. SPECULOOS
  is located at ESO’s Paranal Observatory in the Atacama Desert of Chile, taking full
  advantage of the location’s dark skies, ideal atmospheric conditions, and the support
  systems ESO has there, from telescope infrastructure to staff accommodation. It
  will have a partner, the SPECULOOS Northern Observatory, in the Canary Islands,
  which will hunt for planets in the northern skies not visible from Chile. Together
  they promise to vastly expand our knowledge of the exoplanets in our neighbourhood.

  Sun coalesced to begin the process of star birth. Today, some 190 million years
  later, NGC 6520 is ablaze with hot, massive young stars arrayed in a dandelion seed-shaped
  cluster. Not far away lies the gecko-shaped remains of what may be their birth cloud,
  Barnard 86. This image, taken using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph on Gemini
  South, shows details in a 9.7- x 5.4-arcmin section of a larger, highly populated
  region in the Sagittarius star cloud. It provides the clearest optical view of the
  cluster and its nearby dark-cloud companion. The total mass of the stars in NGC
  6520 is roughly equivalent to 300-400 times the mass of the Sun, while the nearby
  cloud contains enough material to make about 3,000 more stars like the Sun. The
  close proximity between the star cluster and its nearby dark-cloud companion suggests
  the two are related. A survey of the southern sky (released in 2001) that singled
  out hydrogen-alpha emissions from warm, ionized interstellar gas shows a nebula
  extending from the dark globule to embrace the star cluster. Caption: The star cluster

  years old, and lies around 5,500 light-years away from the Sun, in the direction

description: Gemini South image of dragon-like dark nebula NGC 6559 NGC 6559 is a
  relatively small, nearby dust cloud in our Milky Way galaxy that measures about
  seven light-years across. NGC 6559 is part of a larger star-forming region in the
  southern constellation Sagittarius. The dark structure that resembles a Chinese
  dragon is caused by cool dust that absorbs background radiation from hydrogen gas
  that glows in red light due to ionization from nearby stars. The intricate details
  and wispy structure in the dark cloud is determined by turbulence flow dynamics
  influenced by variables such as nearby star radiation and motions of other nearby
  gas and dust. These kinds of clouds illustrate how past generations of stars are
  dispersing heavier elements into our galaxy, material that will seed future generations
  of stars and possibly planetary systems.

description: 'Reflection nebula GGD 27 revealing the chaotic and messy environment
  of a stellar nursery. This near-infrared image was obtained using FLAMINGOS-2, the
  infrared imager and spectrograph on the Gemini South telescope in Chile. Image Credit:
  Gemini Observatory/AURA. An image release by the Gemini Observatory offers a deep,
  revealing view into an active stellar nursery. The infrared view peels back layers
  of obscuring gas and dust to unshroud the inner workings of star formation – and
  the chaos that accompanies the beautifully messy process of starbirth. In the direction
  of the constellation of Sagittarius, some 5,500 light-years away in the southern
  Milky Way, is a chaotic caldron of stellar birth known as GGD 27. While such stellar
  nurseries are sprinkled liberally throughout our Milky Way Galaxy, GGD 27 presents
  an especially compelling snapshot of stellar birth. At first glance it looks like
  chaos. However, this seemingly random cloud of gas and dust is home to several nascent
  stars interacting in complex, but predictable ways. Millions of years from now the
  prenatal cloud of gas and dust will disperse and a cluster of stars will emerge
  much like a butterfly from its chrysalis. Until then this beautiful cloud will slowly
  (by human standards) evolve and allow astronomers to explore the complex process
  of star birth. The new infrared Gemini image peers deep into GGD 27 where a massive
  developing star (called a protostar) dominates the central region of the nebula.
  Identified as GGD 27-ILL this future star already glows several thousand times brighter
  than our Sun and powers a bipolar outflow where gas streams away at supersonic speeds
  propelled by intense magnetic fields. Other forming stars in the area complicate
  the scene while adding to its beauty. See Image Release for details Technical Details:
  It is a color composite made using four filters: Y (blue), J (cyan), H (green),
  and Ks (red). The total integration (exposure time) for all filters is just over
  one hour. The image is 4.6 x 3.5 arcminutes in size and is rotated 35 degrees clockwise
  from North is up and East is to the left.'

  gaseous layers into space, the hot exposed core of the star ionizes the surrounding

description: 'The Eagle Nebula, Messier object 16 (M16), NGC 6611, as seen by the
  Kitt Peak 4-meter Mayall telescope in 1973.  This picture shows an interesting emission
  nebula and its associated galactic star cluster in the constellation of Serpens
  (the Serpent). The star cluster was discovered in 1746 by P.L. de Cheseaux, but
  he missed the surrounding nebulosity, leaving it to be noticed by Charles Messier
  some twenty years later, while he was compiling the catalog that brought him permanent
  fame in astronomy and provided the `M&#x27; numbers we use to designate so many
  of the bright, fuzzy patches visible at night. M16 is one of the more unusual objects
  in the sky, and although it is unfortunately not a naked-eye object, it is a fine
  sight through a telescope of low to moderate power.  M16 is an example of a galactic
  HII region, which is to say that most of the emission comes from the red light of
  ionized (electrically charged) hydrogen gas. The nebula shines because of the energy
  provided by the cluster of hot blue and white stars. These stars are about two million
  years old, which is quite young for a star (our own middle-aged Sun clocks in at
  over four billion years). However, these O and B stars are considerably heavier
  than our Sun, since they contain some thirty times as much matter, and this extra
  weight shortens their lifetime to just a few million years in total. The brightest
  stars, such as the conspicuous double of O stars, are concentrated toward the north-west
  (the top right of this picture). The cluster also contains a large number of faint
  red stars, which are probably reddened by absorption in the dust surrounding them.
  M16 is in a late stage of its evolution, where the hot stars have blown away the
  closer material and now shine in a cavity surrounded by an expanding complex of
  neutral lumps, which show bright edges due to shock waves created as the outwardly
  flowing material hits other gas.  On the southern side there are several bright-edged
  dark lanes or striations crossing the nebula: these are often called `elephant trunk&#x27;
  structures. M16 also contains many small black globules, which are believed to be
  compact dust clouds on their way to collapsing into proto-stellar objects, and then
  later into new stars. Current estimates suggest that several new stars are formed
  somewhere in our Galaxy every year. In fact, the current glowing red appearance
  and the dark features are, respectively, the gas and dust out of which the existing
  stars originally condensed.  There is also evidence for rapid motions in the nebula,
  with suggestions of turbulence around the dark lanes to the north-east (the top
  left). The nebula also contains some neutral gas clouds, which have no electrical
  charge and are only detected by radio astronomers.  M16 is located, along with its
  neighbor, the Omega Nebula, M17, in the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm of our Milky
  Way galaxy.  We also have a spectacular 0.9-meter emission-line image.  Location:

description: 'The Ring Nebula, M57, NGC6720 This true color picture was taken using
  Ektachrome film at the prime focus of the Kitt Peak 4m telescope on September 1st
  1973. This is unusual: normally color images are made by combining black and white
  images taken through different colored filters. The Ring Nebula, also known as M57
  or NGC 6720, is found in the constellation Lyra. A spherical shell of glowing gas
  surrounds a central hot star. The nebula was formed when the central star ejected
  perhaps as much as ten percent of its mass, over a period of some millions of years.
  Initially slow mass loss creates a surrounding shell of material which is later
  ionized by hotter, faster ejecta, which can result in quite complex structures.
  The Ring Nebula was the first planetary nebula discovered, so called because of
  its visual spherical appearance through telescopes in the past. It has a diameter
  a little under one light-year and is 3000 light-years from Earth (angular size 1.2
  arc minutes). Location: 18 hrs 53.6 min +33 deg 02 min (2000) Photograph by Bill

  image of M17 (NGC6618), a region of massive star formation known variously as the
  Omega Nebula, the Swan Nebula, and the Horseshoe Nebula, was created by K. M. Merrill
  to illustrate the potential of the new PAH channel. This filter is centered on the
  location of a dust emission feature at 3.28 microns which shows up in many star
  formation regions, and which is normally attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
  (PAH). The dust is in emission due to the ultra-violet radiation of newly formed
  hot, luminous stars. The 540-second composite J- and K-band exposures were taken
  at the KPNO 2.1-meter telescope on 11 May 2000. The PAH data are archival data from
  the Cryogenic Optical Bench (COB) instrument. This image can be compared to optical

  that this version shows more blue: most renditions of this nebula are decidedly
  reddish in character. However, the object’s altitude during much of the imaging
  – as high as 80 degrees – minimized the normal tendency for blue extinction that

  of the stars ionizes the hydrogen gas, which then recombines and emits the characteristic
  red hydrogen-alpha light. Further out, when the radiation from these hot young stars
  becomes too weak to ionize hydrogen, the gas and dust instead glows by reflecting
  the original blue light. M20 is in the constellation of Sagittarius, at a poorly-known
  distance somewhere between 2200 and 7600 light-years. We also have a deep black

description: This image was obtained with the wide-field view of the Mosaic camera
  on the WIYN 0.9-meter Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory. M17, also informally
  known as the “omega nebula”, the “lobster nebula” and the “swan nebula” (among other
  names), is one of the largest and brightest star-forming regions inside our galaxy.
  Its size and brightness make it one of the first nebulae to be discovered, which
  occurred in 1745. The hydrogen gas that gives it its distinctive red color is energized
  by hot, massive blue stars embedded in the nebula. The image was generated with
  observations in the Hydrogen-alpha (orange), Oxygen [OIII] (green) and Sulfur [SII]
  (blue) filters. In this image, North is left, East is down.

description: This image was obtained with the wide-field view of the Mosaic camera
  on the KPNO 0.9m-meter telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory. M8 is a giant
  star forming region. It is so big that it is faintly visible to the naked eye. The
  gas in the nebula is energized by a massive star at its center, causing the gas
  to glow. The dark objects within the nebula are called Bok globules, and are dense
  clouds of gas in which new stars are forming. The image was generated with observations
  in Hydrogen alpha (red), Oxygen [OIII] (green) and Sulfur [SII] (blue) filters.

description: mage of the central region of the Trifid Nebula (M20 in the Messier Catalogue)
  taken by the Gemini North 8-meter Telescope on Mauna Kea on the Big Island of Hawaii,
  June 5, 2002. Located in the constellation of Sagittarius, the beautiful nebula
  is a much-photographed, dynamic cloud of gas and dust where stars are being born.
  One of the massive stars at the nebula&#x27;s center was born approximately 100,000
  years ago. The nebula&#x27;s distance from the Solar System remains in dispute,
  but it is generally agreed to be somewhere between 2,200 to 9,000 light years away.

description: An image of the open star cluster NGC 6520 and nearby dust cloud Barnard
  86, in the constellation Sagittarius, one of the densest parts of our Galaxy. This
  image was taken on June 24th, 2007 at the NSF&#x27;s Blanco 4-m telescope in CTIO,
  with B (blue), V (green) , I (orange) and H-alpha (red) filters. The bright young
  stars of this star cluster, which probably formed out of gas related to the nearby
  dust cloud, stand out in contrast to the background of older stars of the bulge
  of our Galaxy. This image was released during the 100 Hours of Astronomy webcast,
  &quot;Around the World in 80 Telescopes&quot; held from April 3-4, 2009, during
  the International Year of Astronomy 2009. View the recorded event from CTIO. See
  also this image of the Medusa Nebula from KPNO, which was also released during the
  webcast.

  Survey of 250 million stars in our galaxy’s bulge. The 4 x 2 degrees excerpt can
  be explored in all its whopping 50,000 x 25,000 pixels in this zoomable version.
  In the image interstellar dust and gas seemingly acts like a red “filter” in front
  of the background stars, scattering the blue light away. Since we are surrounded
  by dust and gas in the Milky Way, this scattering effect is important to many parts
  of astronomy and is known as interstellar reddening. DECam was primarily funded
  by the U.S. Department of Energy.

description: Composite image of the Swan Nebula. SOFIA detected the blue areas (20
  microns) near the center, revealing gas as it&#x27;s heated by massive stars located
  at the center and the green areas (37 microns) that trace dust as it&#x27;s warmed
  both by massive stars and nearby newborn stars. The nine never-before-seen protostars
  were found primarily in the southern areas. The red areas near the edge represent
  cold dust that was detected by the Herschel Space Telescope (70 microns), while
  the white star field was detected by the Spitzer Space Telescope (3.6 microns).
  The space telescopes could not observe the blue and green regions in such detail
  because the detectors were saturated. SOFIA&#x27;s view reveals evidence that parts
  of the nebula formed separately to create the swan-like shape seen today.

description: Composite image of the Serpens South Cluster. Magnetic fields observed

  SOFIA&#x27;s data indicate that gravity can overcome some of the strong magnetic
  fields to deliver material needed for new stars. The magnetic fields have been dragged
  into alignment with the most powerful flows, as seen in the lower left where the
  streamlines are following the direction of the narrow, dark filament. This is accelerating
  the flow of material from interstellar space into the cloud, and fueling the collapse
  needed to spark star formation
