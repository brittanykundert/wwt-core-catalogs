description: 'Open stellar cluster Haffner 18, perfectly illustrating three different
  stages of this process of star formation : in the centre of the picture, Haffner
  18, a group of mature stars that have already dispersed their birth nebulae, represents
  the completed product or immediate past of the star formation process. Located at
  the bottom left of this cluster, a very young star, just come into existence and,
  still surrounded by its birth cocoon of gas, provides insight into the very present
  of star birth. Finally, the dust clouds towards the right corner of the image are
  active stellar nurseries that will produce more new stars in the future. Haffner
  18 contains about 50 stars, among which several short lived, massive ones. The massive
  star still surrounded by a small, dense shell of hydrogen, has the rather cryptic
  name of FM3060a. The shell is about 2.5 light-years wide and expands at a speed
  of 20 km/s. It must have been created some 40,000 years ago. The cluster is between
  25,000 and 30,000 light-years away from us.'

description: It’s impossible to miss the star in this ESO Picture of the Week — beaming
  proudly from the centre of the frame is the massive multiple star system Tau Canis
  Majoris, the brightest member of the Tau Canis Majoris Cluster (NGC 2362) in the
  eponymous constellation of Canis Major (The Great Dog). Tau Canis Majoris aside,
  the cluster is populated by many young and less attention-seeking stars that are
  only four or five million years old, all just beginning their cosmic lifetimes.
  The Tau Canis Majoris Cluster is an open cluster — a group of stars born from the
  same molecular cloud. This means that all of the cluster’s inhabitants share a common
  chemical composition and are loosely bound together by gravity. Having been born
  together, they make an ideal stellar laboratory to test theories of stellar evolution,
  the chain of events that leads from a star’s birth in a cool, dense cloud of gas
  through to its eventual death. Though the stars in this image were all created at
  the same time, their various different masses mean they will lead very different
  lives. As Tau Canis Majoris is one of the most massive and short-lived types of
  star, it will burn through its nuclear fuel long before its smaller companions,
  which will keep on shining for billions of years. This image was created as part
  of the ESO Cosmic Gems programme, an outreach initiative to produce images of interesting,
  intriguing or visually attractive objects using ESO telescopes, for the purposes
  of education and public outreach. The programme makes use of telescope time that
  cannot be used for science observations. All data collected may also be suitable
  for scientific purposes, and are made available to astronomers through ESO’s science
  archive.

description: This red-hued cloud of gas is named Abell 24, and is located in the constellation
  of Canis Minor (The Lesser Dog). It is something known as a planetary nebula — a
  burst of gas and dust created when a star dies and throws its outer layers into
  space. Despite the name, planetary nebulae have nothing to do with planets. The
  term was coined by William Herschel, who also famously discovered Uranus; in a time
  of low-resolution astronomy, these nebulous objects appeared to resemble giant planets
  swimming in a dark cosmos.  A Sun-like star spends most of its life converting hydrogen
  into helium in its core. In its twilight years the star runs out of fuel and becomes
  unbalanced; it can no longer resist the inward crush of gravity and the core begins
  to collapse. The temperature in the core rises dramatically while the cooler outer
  layers expand, causing the entire star to bloat into a red giant. When the Sun begins
  its transformation into a red giant it will expand to completely engulf the innermost
  planets and possibly also the Earth, growing to over 250 times its current radius!
  Strong winds then expel the gaseous outer layers of the star, forming a shell of
  gas that spreads out into the vastness of space. The red giant&#x27;s venting atmosphere
  will eventually expose its hot, luminous remnant core, which will emit fierce ultraviolet
  radiation and ionise the surrounding gas. This image shows the faint nebulous glow
  of a stellar swansong — the bright remnant of a long-dead star. Taken with the VLT’s FORS
  (FOcal Reducer and Spectrograph) instrument, this image is part of the ESO Cosmic
  Gems programme, an initiative to produce images of scientifically interesting and
  visually attractive objects using ESO telescopes for the purposes of education and
  public outreach. The programme makes use of telescope time that cannot be used for
  science observations. All data collected may also be suitable for scientific purposes,
  and are made available to astronomers through ESO’s science archive.

description: This gently glowing area of sky is actually a hot bubble of hydrogen
  gas — named Sh 2-305 — that has been bombarded by intense radiation from nearby
  stars. Such gas clouds are known as emission nebulae, or HII regions (pronounced
  “H-two”). The radiation in question is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum and
  is thought to emanate from at least two O-type stars, and likely several others.
  This stellar class is the brightest and hottest that we know of — such stars can
  be up to 90 times as massive as the Sun, and an incredible one million times as
  bright. Together with five neighbouring bubbles, Sh 2-305 belongs to a giant complex

  a type of emission nebulae, are created when young, massive stars release enough
  ultraviolet energy to ionise the surrounding gas clouds. These regions tend to have

description: An extremely active stellar nursery glows in deep reddish tones in this
  Gemini view of NGC2467 in the southern constellation of Puppis. The image displays
  a striking array of features that illustrate multiple phases of star birth. In the
  lower right, young stars are emitting hot radiation, exciting the nearby gas and
  causing it to glow and revealing denser gas and dust clouds. Dust lanes and dark
  globules mark sites of future star formation. A cluster of young stars dominates
  the left edge of the field of view. It is likely that several million years ago
  this region resembled the currently active star birth regions seen in the right
  half of the image. A “wall” of denser material dominates the right side of the image.
  Here ultraviolet radiation from nearby stars is removing material by a process called
  photo-evaporation and revealing underlying dense clouds that likely harbor forming
  stars. At bottom left a star can be seen exciting the cocoon of gas and dust from
  which it likely emerged. The NGC2467 complex lies about 17,000 light-years away.
  Its distance has been calculated based upon a likely association with a nearby cluster
  (Haffner 19, not within image). This image was obtained on December 5, 2004 using
  the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) on the Gemini South telescope at Cerro
  Pachón in Chile. See also the Gemini Image Release.

description: New observations of the richly populated star cluster NGC 2420 taken
  by the refurbished WIYN 0.9-meter telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory suggest
  that the cluster contains a multitude of clues about the history and evolution of
  the Milky Way. NGC 2420 consists of approximately 1,000 stars packed into a roughly
  spherical volume of space just 30 light-years in diameter. Because all of the stars
  in a star cluster have similar ages and initial compositions, star clusters can
  be used as a laboratory to study many different areas of astronomy. Further details
  of this interesting result can be found in NOAO press release 02-04.

description: Thor’s Helmet in Canis Major is about 15,000 light years distant. A large
  bright star near the helmet’s center has created this interstellar bubble by the
  force of its “stellar wind”. However, this star, known as a Wolf-Rayet star, may
  go supernova in the relatively near astronomical future. In the meantime, we can
  continue to enjoy images of NGC 2359. This image was created by first assembling
  a simple RGB from the 2 hours/channel RGB data. The H-alpha data was layered over
  the red in Photoshop’s lighten mode; the same with the OIII data for the green and
  blue channels. This allowed us to create an image with RGB stars but enhanced nebula
  detail from the H-alpha and OIII data. Then a composite (H-alpha+OIII) layer was
  pasted over the (R+Ha)(G+OIII)(B+OIII) image. The opacity of the composite layer
  was reduced somewhat to allow the RGB stars to shine through. The star appearance
  was kept relatively subdued, so as not to detract from the nebula.
