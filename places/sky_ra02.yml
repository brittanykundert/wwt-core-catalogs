description: Glowing in the cosmos at a distance of about 50 million light-years away,
  the galaxy NGC 936 bears a striking resemblance to the Twin Ion Engine (TIE) starfighters
  used by the evil Dark Lord Darth Vader and his crew in the epic motion picture Star
  Wars. The galaxy’s shiny bulge and a bar-like structure crossing it bring to mind
  the central engine and cockpit of the spacecraft; while a ring of stars surrounding
  the galactic core completes the parallel, corresponding to the wings of the TIE
  fighters that are equipped with solar panels. This galaxy harbours exclusively old
  stars and shows no sign of any recent star formation. Bars such as that observed
  in NGC 936 are common features of galaxies; however, this one is significantly more
  marked than average. Although a perfect symbol for the dark side of the “Force”,
  it is still debatable whether this galaxy is dominated, like most others, by a large
  amount of dark matter. This image has been obtained using the FORS instrument mounted
  on one of the 8.2-metre telescopes of ESO’s Very Large Telescope on top of Cerro
  Paranal, Chile. It combines data acquired through four wide-band filters (B, V,

description: 'Two galaxies, about 50 million light-years away, are locked in a galactic
  embrace — literally. The Seyfert galaxy NGC 1097, in the constellation of Fornax
  (The Furnace), is seen in this image taken with the VIMOS instrument on ESO’s Very
  Large Telescope (VLT). A comparatively tiny elliptical companion galaxy, NGC 1097A,
  is also visible in the top left. There is evidence that NGC 1097 and NGC 1097A have
  been interacting in the recent past. Although NGC 1097 seems to be wrapping its
  companion in its spiral arms, this is no gentle motherly giant. The larger galaxy
  also has four faint jets — too extended and faint to be seen in this image — that
  emerge from its centre, forming an X-shaped pattern, and which are the longest visible-wavelength
  jets of any known galaxy. The jets are thought to be the remnants of a dwarf galaxy
  that was disrupted and cannibalised by the much larger NGC 1097 up to a few billion
  years ago. These unusual jets are not the galaxy’s only intriguing feature. As previously
  mentioned, NGC 1097 is a Seyfert galaxy, meaning that it contains a supermassive
  black hole in its centre. However, the core of NGC 1097 is relatively faint, suggesting
  that the central black hole is not currently swallowing large quantities of gas
  and stars. Instead, the most striking feature of the galaxy’s centre is the ring
  of bright knots surrounding the nucleus. These knots are thought to be large bubbles
  of glowing hydrogen gas about 750–2500 light-years across, ionised by the intense
  ultraviolet light of young stars, and they indicate that the ring is a site of vigorous
  star formation With this distinctive central star-forming ring, and the addition
  of numerous bluish clusters of hot, young stars dotted through its spiral arms,
  NGC 1097 makes a stunning visual object. The data were originally taken in 2004
  (see eso0438) with the VIMOS instrument on the VLT, and additional colour information
  from an image taken by amateur astronomer Robert Gendler has been superimposed.
  The VLT data were taken through three visible-light filters: R (at a wavelength
  of 652 nanometres, and shown here in red), V (a wavelength of 540 nanometres, shown
  in green), and B (456 nanometres, shown in blue). The image covers a region of approximately
  7.7 x 6.6 arcminutes on the sky.'

description: This beautiful image portrays the galaxies NGC 799 (below) and NGC 800
  (above) located in the constellation of Cetus (The Whale). This pair of galaxies
  was first observed by the American astronomer Lewis Swift back in 1885. Located
  at a distance of about 300 million light-years, our face-on view allows us to clearly
  appreciate their shapes. Like the Milky Way — our galaxy — these objects are both
  spiral galaxies, with characteristic long arms winding towards a bright bulge at
  the centre. In the prominent spiral arms, a large number of hot, young, blue stars
  are forming in clusters (tiny blue dots seen in the image) whereas in the central
  bulge a large group of cooler, redder, old stars are packed into a compact, almost
  spherical region. At first glance, these galaxies look rather similar, but the devil
  is in the detail. Apart from the obvious difference in size, only NGC 799 has a
  bar structure, extending from its central bulge, and the spiral arms wind out from
  the ends of the bar. Galactic bars are thought to act as a mechanism that channels
  gas from the spiral arms to the centre, intensifying star formation. A supernova
  was also observed in NGC 799 in 2004, and was given the name SN2004dt. Another interesting
  differentiating feature is the number of spiral arms. The small NGC 800 has three
  bright, knotty spiral arms, whilst NGC 799 only has two relatively dim, but broad
  spiral arms. These start at the end of the bar and wrap nearly completely around
  the galaxy forming a structure that looks almost like a ring. While it might seem
  that this image depicts two impressive close spiral galaxies coexisting in an everlasting
  peace, nothing can be further than the truth. We could be just witnessing the calm
  before the storm. We don’t know exactly what the future will bring, but typically,
  when two galaxies are close enough, they interact over hundreds of millions of years
  by means of gravitational disturbances. In some cases, only minor interactions occur,
  causing shape distortions, but sometimes galaxies collide, merging to form a single,
  new and larger galaxy. The image was obtained using the FORS1 instrument on the
  8.2-metre ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) atop Cerro Paranal, Chile. It combines
  exposures taken through three filters (B, V, R). Five asteroids can also be seen
  — can you find them all? The asteroids moved between the different exposures leaving
  colourful streaks in the image.

description: This picture of the week shows the spiral galaxy NGC 986 in the constellation
  of Fornax (The Furnace). The galaxy, which was discovered in 1826 by the Scottish
  astronomer James Dunlop, is not often imaged due to its proximity to the famous
  and rich Fornax Cluster of galaxies. Which is a shame, as this galaxy is not only
  a great scientific object, but also very pretty. The galaxy is about 56 million
  light-years away and seen almost perfectly from the top, or — as astronomers say
  — face-on. This allows us to see the two main spiral arms and also a central bar-shaped
  structure, composed of stars and dust, which makes it a barred spiral galaxy. Astronomical
  surveys have shown that about two thirds of all spiral galaxies contain a bar, including
  the Milky Way. This makes NGC 986 the perfect place to study the structure of galaxies
  and find out more about our own home galaxy, which is difficult to study from within.
  This view from the FORS instrument on ESO’s Very Large Telescope at the Paranal
  Observatory in northern Chile comes from the ESO Cosmic Gems programme, an outreach
  initiative to produce images of interesting, intriguing or visually attractive objects
  using ESO telescopes, for the purposes of education and public outreach. The programme
  makes use of telescope time that cannot be used for science observations. All data
  collected may also be suitable for scientific purposes, and are made available to
  astronomers through ESO’s science archive.

description: The Silver Sliver Galaxy — more formally known as NGC 891 — is shown
  in this striking image from the Mosaic instrument on the 4-meter Nicholas U. Mayall
  Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory, a Program of NSF’s NOIRLab. NGC 891
  is a spiral galaxy that lies almost perfectly edge-on to us, leading to its elongated
  appearance and its striking resemblance to our home galaxy, the Milky Way, as seen
  from the Earth. Since NGC 891 is oriented edge-on, it’s great for investigating
  the galactic fountain model. When stellar winds and supernovae from the disk of
  a galaxy eject gas into the surrounding medium, it can create condensation that
  rains back down onto the disk. The condensed gas then provides new fuel for star
  formation. In addition to the portrait of NGC 891, this image is littered with astronomical
  objects near and far — bright foreground stars from our own galaxy intrude upon
  the view of NGC 891 and distant galaxies lurk in the background.

  (NGC869) are about 7000 light-years away and less than 100 light-years apart. Although
  open clusters are quite common, this pair is exceptional due to the large number
  of young bright O and B stars in each, and their closeness whilst still being clearly
  distinguished. This color picture was made from CCD images taken in September 1997
  at the Burrell Schmidt telescope of the Warner and Swasey Observatory of the Case
  Western Reserve University, located on Kitt Peak in southwestern Arizona.

description: Magnetic fields in NGC 1068, or M77, are shown as streamlines over a
  visible light and X-ray composite image of the galaxy from the Hubble Space Telescope,
  the Nuclear Spectroscopic Array, and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The magnetic
  fields align along the entire length of the massive spiral arms — 24,000 light years
  across (0.8 kiloparsecs) — implying that the gravitational forces that created the
  galaxy’s shape are also compressing the magnetic fields. This supports the leading
  theory of how the spiral arms are forced into their iconic shape known as density
  wave theory. SOFIA studied the galaxy using far-infrared light (89 microns) to reveal
  facets of its magnetic fields that previous observations using visible and radio
  telescopes could not detect.
