description: NGC 3627, also known as Messier 66, i.e. it is the 66th object in the
  famous catalogue of nebulae by French astronomer Charles Messier (1730 - 1817).
  It is located in the constellation Leo (The Lion). NGC 3627 is a beautiful spiral
  with a well-developed central bulge. It also displays large-scale dust lanes. Many
  regions of warm hydrogen gas are seen throughout the disc of this galaxy. The latter
  regions are being ionised by radiation from clusters of newborn stars. Very active
  star-formation is most likely also occurring in the nuclear regions of NGC 3627.
  The galaxy forms, together with its neighbours M 65 and NGC 3628, the so-called
  &quot;Leo Triplet&quot; ; they are located at a distance of about 35 million light-years.
  M 66 is the largest of the three. Its spiral arms appear distorted and displaced
  above the main plane of the galaxy. The asymmetric appearance is most likely due
  to gravitational interaction with its neighbours. This photo of the spiral galaxy
  M 66 (or NGC 3627) was obtained with the FORS1 and FORS2 multi-mode instruments
  (at VLT MELIPAL and YEPUN, respectively) on December 16-18, 2001. It is a composite
  of three exposures in different wavebands. North is towards upper left, West towards
  upper right.

description: These images of the NGC 3603 region were obtained in three near-IR filter
  bands (Js, H and Ks) with the ISAAC instrument at the ANTU telescope at the VLT
  at Paranal. NGC 3603 is located in the Carina spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy
  at a distance of about 20,000 light-years (6-7 kpc). It is the only massive, galactic
  &quot;HII-region&quot; (so denoted by astronomers because part of its hydrogen is
  ionized) in which a central cluster of strongly UV-radiating stars of types O and
  B that ionize the nebula can be studied at visual and near-infrared wavelengths.
  This is because the line-of-sight is reasonably free of dust in this direction;
  the dimming in near-infrared radiation due to intervening matter between the nebula
  and us is only about a factor of 2 (compared to 80 in visible light). The total
  mass of the hot O and B stars in NGC 3603 is over 2,000 solar masses. Together,
  the more than fifty heavy and bright O stars in NGC 3603 have about 100 times the
  ionizing power of the well-known Trapezium cluster in the Orion Nebula. In fact,
  the star cluster in NGC 3603 is in many respects very similar to the core of the
  large, ionizing cluster in the approximately eight times more distant Tarantula
  Nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud. An important conclusion of studying this region
  is that there are lots of sub-solar mass stars in NGC 3603. Contrary to several
  theoretical predictions, these low-mass stars do form in violent starbursts. The
  overall age of stars in the contraction phase that are located in the innermost
  region of NGC 3603 was found to be  300 000 to 1 000 000 years. The counts clearly
  show that this cluster is well populated in sub-solar mass stars. This image is
  available as a mounted image in the ESOshop.

description: 'NGC 3628 is a spiral galaxy and a member of a small, but conspicuous
  group of galaxies located about 35 million light-years away, toward the constellation
  of Leo (the Lion). The other distinguished members of this family, known collectively
  as the Leo Triplet, are two well-known prominent spiral galaxies, Messier 65 and
  Messier 66 (not seen on the image), which were both discovered in 1780 by famous
  French comet hunter Charles Messier. NGC 3628 is the faintest of the trio and escaped
  Messier’s observations with his rather small telescope. It was discovered and catalogued
  by William Herschel only four years later. NGC 3628 hides its spiral structure because
  it is seen perfectly edge-on, exactly as we observe the Milky Way on a clear night.
  Its most distinctive feature is a dark band of dust that lies across the plane of
  the disc and which is visibly distorted outwards, as a consequence of the gravitational
  interaction between NGC 3628 and its bullying companions. This boxy or “peanut-shaped”
  bulge, seen as a faint X-shape, is formed mainly of young stars and gas and dust,
  which create the bulge away from the plane of the rest of the galaxy through their
  powerful motions. Because of its appearance, NGC 3628 was catalogued as Arp 317
  in the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies, published in 1966, which aimed to characterise
  a large sample of odd objects that fell outside the standard Hubble classification,
  to aid understanding of how galaxies evolve. The depth of the image reveals a myriad
  of galaxies of different shapes and colours, some of which lie much further away
  than NGC 3628. Particularly noticeable is the fuzzy blob just in the centre of the
  image, which is a diffuse satellite galaxy. A number of globular clusters can be
  seen as fuzzy reddish spots in the halo of the galaxy. Also visible as bright spots
  near the lower edge of the image (the two blue star-like objects below the satellite
  galaxy) are two quasars, the central engines of distant and very energetic galaxies,
  billions of light-years away. This image has been taken with the FORS2 instrument,
  attached to one of the ESO Very Large Telescope’s Unit Telescopes. It is a combination
  of exposures taken through different filters (B, V and R), for a total exposure
  time of just below one hour. The field of view is about 7 arcminutes across, which
  is why this large galaxy does not fit into the image. Links  Image of Messier 66 '

description: This image, from ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT), shows a truly remarkable
  galaxy known as NGC 3621. To begin with, it is a pure-disc galaxy. Like other spirals,
  it has a flat disc permeated by dark lanes of material and with prominent spiral
  arms where young stars are forming in clusters (the blue dots seen in the image).
  But while most spiral galaxies have a central bulge — a large group of old stars
  packed in a compact, spheroidal region — NGC 3621 doesn’t. In this image, it is
  clear that there is simply a brightening to the centre, but no actual bulge like
  the one in NGC 6744 (eso1118), for example. NGC 3621 is also interesting as it is
  believed to have an active supermassive black hole at its centre that is engulfing
  matter and producing radiation. This is somewhat unusual because most of these so-called
  active galactic nuclei exist in galaxies with prominent bulges. In this particular
  case, the supermassive black hole is thought to have a relatively small mass, of
  around 20 000 times that of the Sun. Another interesting feature is that there are
  also thought to be two smaller black holes, with masses of a few thousand times
  that of the Sun, near the nucleus of the galaxy. Therefore, NGC 3621 is an extremely
  interesting object which, despite not having a central bulge, has a system of three
  black holes in its central region. This galaxy is located in the constellation of
  Hydra (The Sea Snake) and can be seen with a moderate-sized telescope. This image,
  taken using B, V, and I filters with the FORS1 instrument on the powerful VLT, shows
  striking detail in this odd object and also reveals a multitude of background galaxies.
  A number of bright foreground stars that belong to our own Milky Way are also visible.

description: 'The  picture is part of the COMBO-17 survey (Classifying Objects by  Medium-Band
  Observations in 17 Filters), a project dedicated to  recording detailed images of
  small patches of the sky through filters of  17 different colours. The area covered
  in this image is only about the  size of the full Moon, but thousands of galaxies
  can be identified just  within this small region. The  image was taken with an exposure
  time of almost seven hours, which  allowed the camera to capture the light from
  very faint and distant  objects, as well as those that are closer to us. Galaxies
  with clear and  regular structures, such as the spiral specimen viewed edge-on near
  the  upper left corner, are only up to a few billion light-years away. The  fainter,
  fuzzier objects are so far away that it has taken nine or ten  billion years for
  their light to reach us. The  COMBO-17 survey is a powerful tool for studying the
  distribution of  dark matter in galaxies. Dark matter is a mysterious substance
  that does  not emit or absorb light and can only be detected by its gravitational  pull
  on other objects. Some of the closer galaxies pictured act as  lenses that distort
  the light coming from more distant galaxies placed  along the same line of sight.
  By measuring this distortion, an effect  known as gravitational lensing, astronomers
  are able to understand how  dark matter is distributed in the objects that act as
  lenses. The  distortion is weak and, therefore, almost imperceptible to the human  eye.
  However, because surveying the sky with 17 filters allows extremely  precise distance
  measurements, it is possible to determine if two  galaxies that appear to lie close
  to each other are actually at very  different distances from the Earth. After identifying
  the galactic  lensing systems, the distortion can be measured by averaging over  thousands
  of galaxies. With more than 4000 galactic lenses identified,  this COMBO-17 survey
  is an ideal method to help astronomers to  understand the dark matter better. This  image
  was taken with three of the 17 filters from the project: B  (blue), V (green), and
  R (red). Data through an additional near-infrared  filter was also used.  Links  COMBO-17

description: This fetching cloud of gas was imaged by the ESO Faint Object Spectrograph
  and Camera (EFOSC2) at ESO&#x27;s La Silla Observatory. It can be found nestled
  in the busy constellation of Centaurus in the skies of the southern hemisphere.
  The cloud of gas — named NGC 3699 — is a planetary nebula, It is distinguished by
  an irregular mottled appearance and a dark rift, which roughly bisects it. These
  objects, despite the name, have nothing to do with planets and are created in the
  final stages of the evolution of stars similar in mass to the Sun. The name &quot;planetary
  nebula&quot; arises from the time of their discovery by William Herschel, when they
  appeared in the telescopes of the time as rounded objects similar in looks to the
  planets. Towards the end of their lives, stars like the Sun exhaust the supply of
  hydrogen in their cores, putting a stop to nuclear reactions. This causes the star&#x27;s
  core to contract under the force of gravity and heat up, while the cooler outer
  layers expand tremendously — the surface of the Sun, for example, will likely engulf
  the orbit of Earth when it reaches this stage in its evolution. Unusually strong
  stellar winds push the gaseous outer layers of the star out into space, eventually
  exposing the core of the star, which begins to emit ultraviolet radiation, ionising
  the expelled gas, causing the nebula&#x27;s ethereal glow, and producing beautiful
  and varied sights, such as the one in this image.

description: Do you ever get the feeling that you&#x27;re being watched? This friendly-looking
  object is the result of two galaxies merging into one another, complete with a pair
  of eyes hiding two growing supermassive black holes and a swirling grin. Such mergers
  are rare in our galactic neighbourhood; Mrk 739 is close enough (astronomically
  speaking) to study the event in detail, and thus gain a better understanding of
  the dramatic processes that take place during these cosmic mergers. By using the
  MUSE instrument on ESO’s Very Large Telescope, the team of astronomers, led by master’s
  student Dusán Tubín at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, were able to
  study the effects of both the merger and the radiation emitted by the growing gigantic
  black holes. Their study answers questions about the motion of the galaxies, the
  age of their stars, and the elements they are made up of. They have found that one
  of these galaxies is much older than its companion, and that their merging process
  is at an early stage. MUSE is a 3D spectrograph that takes images — known as “datacubes”
  — of the object being observed over thousands of wavelengths. With MUSE, astronomers
  are therefore able to map in great detail the properties of the objects they study,
  because each individual pixel contains an impressive amount of information. Obtaining
  these exciting insights into galaxy merging and evolution with MUSE is enough to
  make anyone smile.

  includes M108 and possibly M106. This picture was created from observations using
  the T2KA CCD camera at the Kitt Peak National Observatory&#x27;s 0.9-meter telescope
  in January of 1997.

description: This small group of galaxies consists of the Messier objects M65 (NGC3623),
  lower right, and M66 (NGC3627), lower left, along with the edge-on spiral galaxy
  NGC3628, upper left. These three galaxies form a rather attractive triplet at the
  heart of the M66 group, which includes a number of other galaxies which are &quot;out
  of shot&quot;. The Leo Triplet also appears in Arp&#x27;s Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies.
  At a distance of 35 million light-years, maybe a little further, the M66 group may
  be related to M96 (NGC3368) and the Leo I galaxy group.  This approximately true-color
  picture was created from images taken in June 1995 using BVR colors, at the Burrell
  Schmidt telescope of Case Western Reserve University&#x27;s Warner and Swasey Observatory
  located on Kitt Peak, near Tucson, Arizona, during the Research Experiences for
  Undergraduates (REU) program operated at the Kitt Peak National Observatory and
  supported by the National Science Foundation. Image size 40.6x50.8 arc minutes.
