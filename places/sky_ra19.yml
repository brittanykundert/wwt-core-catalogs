description: 'Colour composite of some of the first astronomical exposures obtained
  by YEPUN . The object is the planetary nebula Hen 2-428 that is located at a distance
  of 6,000-8,000 light-years and seen in a dense sky field, only 2° from the main
  plane of the Milky Way. As other planetary nebulae, it is caused by a dying star
  (the bluish object at the centre) that shreds its outer layers. The image is based
  on exposures through three optical filtres: B(lue) (10 min exposure, seeing 0.9
  arcsec; here rendered as blue), V(isual) (5 min; 0.9 arcsec; green) and R(ed) (3
  min; 0.9 arcsec; red). The field measures 88 x 78 arcsec 2 (1 pixel = 0.09 arcsec).
  North is to the lower right and East is to the lower left. The 5-day old Moon was
  about 90° away in the sky that was accordingly bright. The zenith angle was 44°.'

  which astronomers have dubbed &#x27;The Bird&#x27; - although it also bears resemblance
  with a cosmic Tinker Bell - is composed of two massive spiral galaxies and a third
  irregular galaxy. In this image, a 30-min VLT/NACO K-band exposure has been combined
  with archive HST/ACS B and I-band images to produce a three-colour image of the
  &#x27;Bird&#x27; interacting galaxy system. The NACO image has allowed astronomers
  to not only see the two previously known galaxies, but to identify a third, clearly
  separate component, an irregular, yet fairly massive galaxy that seems to form stars
  at a frantic rate.

  is as a tracer of cloud structure. The J-, H-, and K-band intensities are coded
  with blue, green, and red colours. The gradual saturation of the near-infrared bands
  is visible as a change of colour. In diffuse regions the shorter wavelength J-band
  is strong and the colour is bluish. When the J-band saturates the colour changes
  first to green and finally, in the centre of the filament, the red colour corresponding
  to the K-band becomes the strongest. In the most saturated regions the surface brightness
  data can only be used to derive a lower limit for the total amount of dust on the

  centre, a clutch of massive, scorching stars send waves of matter smashing into
  surrounding interstellar material, generating a glowing structure that appears ring-like

  young stars are dotted across Barnard’s Galaxy.   The image was made from data obtained

description: The Dumbbell Nebula ­— also known as Messier 27 or NGC 6853 — is a typical

  in 1764 and included it as no. 27 in his famous list of extended sky objects [2]
  .Despite its class, the Dumbbell Nebula has nothing to do with planets. It consists
  of very rarified gas that has been ejected from the hot central star (well visible
  on this photo), now in one of the last evolutionary stages. The gas atoms in the
  nebula are excited (heated) by the intense ultraviolet radiation from this star
  and emit strongly at specific wavelengths.This image is the beautiful by-product
  of a technical test of some FORS1 narrow-band optical interference filtres. They
  only allow light in a small wavelength range to pass and are used to isolate emissions
  from particular atoms and ions. In this three-colour composite, a short exposure
  was first made through a wide-band filtre registering blue light from the nebula.
  It was then combined with exposures through two interference filtres in the light
  of double-ionized oxygen atoms and atomic hydrogen. They were colour-coded as “blue”,
  “green” and “red”, respectively, and then combined to produce this picture that
  shows the structure of the nebula in “approximately true” colours.They are three-colour
  composite based on two interference ([OIII] at 501 nm and 6 nm FWHM — 5 min exposure
  time; H-alpha at 656 nm and 6 nm FWHM — 5 min) and one broadband (Bessell B at 429 nm

description: 'Using 39 of the 66 antennas of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
  Array (ALMA), located 5000 metres up on the Chajnantor plateau in the Chilean Andes,
  astronomers have been able to detect carbon monoxide (CO) in the disc of debris
  around an F-type star. Although carbon monoxide is the second most common molecule
  in the interstellar medium, after molecular hydrogen, this is the first time that
  CO has been detected around a star of this type. The star, named HD 181327, is a
  member of the Beta Pictoris moving group, located almost 170 light-years from Earth.
  Until now, the presence of CO has been detected only around a few A-type stars, substantially more
  massive and luminous than HD 181327. Using the superb spatial resolution and sensitivity
  offered by the ALMA observatory astronomers were now able to capture this stunning
  ring of smoke and map the density of the CO within the disc. The study of debris
  discs is one way to characterise planetary systems and the results of planet formation.
  The CO gas is found to be co-located with the dust grains in the ring of debris
  and to have been produced recently. Destructive collisions of icy planetesimals
  in the disc are possible sources for the continuous replenishment of the CO gas.
  Collisions in debris discs typically require the icy bodies to be gravitationally  perturbed
  by larger objects in order to reach sufficient collisional velocities. Moreover,
  the derived CO composition of the icy planetesimals in the disc is consistent with
  the comets in our Solar System. This possible  secondary origin for the CO gas suggests
  that icy comets could be common around stars similar to our Sun which has strong  implications
  for life suitability in terrestrial exoplanets. The results were published in the
  journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society under the title “Exocometary
  gas in the HD 181327 debris ring” by S. Marino et al. Link:  Paper by Marino et

  are typically smaller and host a relatively small number of stars. Gravitational

description: 'This object is possibly the oldest of its kind ever catalogued: the
  hourglass-shaped remnant named CK Vulpeculae. Originally thought to be a nova, classifying
  this unusually shaped object correctly has proven challenging over the years. A
  number of possible explanations for its origins have been considered and discarded.
  It is now thought to be the result of two stars colliding — although there is still
  debate about what type of stars they were. CK Vulpeculae was first spotted on 20
  June 1670 by French monk and astronomer Père Dom Anthelme. When it first appeared
  it was easily visible with the naked eye; over the subsequent two years the flare
  varied in brightness and disappeared and reappeared twice, before finally vanishing
  from view for good. During the twentieth century, astronomers came to understand
  that most novae could be explained by the runaway explosive behaviour and interactions
  between two close stars in a binary system. The features seen around CK Vulpeculae
  didn’t seem to fit this model particularly well,however, puzzling astronomers for
  many years. The central part of the remnant has now been studied in detail using
  the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). This striking image shows
  the best view of the object to date, and traces the cosmic dust and emission within
  and around CK Vulpeculae to reveal its intricate structure. CK Vulpeculae harbours
  a warped dusty disc at its centre and gaseous jets which indicate some central system
  propelling material outwards. These new observations are the first to bring this
  system into focus, suggesting a solution to a 348 year-old mystery.'

description: This is SS 433, a microquasar first discovered forty years ago and located
  about 18 000 light-years away in the constellation of Aquila (The Eagle). This image,
  captured for the very first time at submillimeter wavelengths by the Atacama Large
  Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), is special because it shows the jets emitted
  by a hot, swirling disc of material encircling the black hole at SS 433’s centre.
  Owing to its relative proximity, SS 433 is a particularly useful object for researchers
  looking to learn more about microquasars and the jets they emit. The corkscrew shape
  visible here is created by a phenomenon known as precession; as they move outwards
  through space, these two jets are slowly tumbling around an axis in a similar way
  to the motion of a gyroscope or a spinning top slowing down, the orientation of
  their rotational axes changing as they do so. The scale of this corkscrew is enormous,
  at 5000 times the size of the Solar System. One remarkable aspect of this observation
  is that its detailed shape was entirely predicted from spectroscopic measurements
  by the Global Jet Watch telescopes in the preceding year before the ALMA observations
  were made. The sequence of these observations allowed researchers to make and test
  predictions about the paths the jets would take, representing a new milestone in
  the study of microquasars. The observations have also resolved the question of why
  the jets are still hot at such great distances from their origin — ALMA’s sensitivity
  enabled researchers to identify that reheating of the plasma occurs when successive
  jet surges expand and collide with one another.

description: The ongoing large-scale ATOMIUM project is being conducted in collaboration
  with ALMA, the Atacama Large  Millimeter/submillimeter Array, which is located in
  Chile and has ESO as a partner.The project set out to map the stellar winds blowing
  out from around a dozen red giant stars, an ambitious goal made possible thanks
  to ALMA’s spectacular resolution. These stellar winds — which are sometimes millions
  of times stronger than those of our Sun — were expected to be spherical, like the
  parent stars that they are blasted away from.  However, researchers did not observe
  spherical stellar winds, but something quite different. As seen in the above image
  — which shows winds around a star called R Aquilae — the team found that in all
  cases the stellar winds were not spherical, but had different shapes, including
  some resembling the delicate petals of a rose. The patterns seen in the stellar
  winds have a striking resemblance to those of planetary nebulae.  The research team,
  led by Leen Decin at KULeuven, Belgium, proposed that a process known as binary
  interaction is responsible for the shape of the stellar winds of red giant stars.
  As the name suggests, binary interaction involves two objects. The theory is that
  the stellar winds achieve their shape due to the influence of another star, or a
  giant planet. Stellar winds are the precursors to planetary nebulae, and the apparent
  similarity in their structures indicates that the physics that shapes stellar winds
  also shapes planetary nebulae, and hence that binary interaction is the key agent
  carving out the planetary nebulae morphologies.

description: Space can be a lonely place. But not so for this quartet of galaxies
  making up HCG 86 and observed here with ESO’s VLT Survey Telescope (VST). The four
  galaxies located approximately 270 million light years from Earth in the Sagittarius
  constellation, are seen from Earth as arranged in triangular shape, with three of
  them on a straight line and one underneath; the bright objects to the right of the
  elongated galaxy are not part of the quartet. HCG stands for Hickson Compact Group,
  and is used to describe groups of four to ten galaxies where members are physically
  very close to each other. Because of their compactness, such groups are ideal environments
  to study galactic interactions, which can sometimes lead to galaxies merging with
  each other.   This image of HCG 86 was taken by a team of astronomers led by Rossella
  Ragusa of the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica in Italy as part of the VST Early-type
  Galaxy Survey (VEGAS) programme. “With VST we are able to investigate very faint
  structures in the galaxies&#x27; outskirts, which are the relics of past gravitational
  interactions and merging events,” says Ragusa. In particular, by mapping the light
  distribution in and around the group’s galaxies in this study, the team concluded
  that these faint structures are the leftovers of satellite galaxies gobbled by the
  group approximately seven billion years ago. Located at ESO’s Paranal Observatory
  in Chile, the VST is one of the world’s largest survey telescopes, devoted to mapping
  the sky in visible light wavelengths. 2021 marks the anniversary of its first decade
  of operation, a period during which it has helped to search for planets outside
  the Solar System and probe the structure of our galaxy and the wider Universe.

  interstellar medium, and not to be connected in any way with the formation of planetary
  systems. At a distance of approximately 850 light-years, this is one of the closest
  known planetary nebulae: however, as with all planetary nebulae this distance is
  not very well known and could be wrong by even as much as a factor of two. Photograph

  a binary star system that contains a black hole. The Cygnus X-1 system looks like
  a single star in this image. It is the brighter (bottom) of the two stars near the
  center of the image. Gas from the companion star is being pulled into the black
  hole. Before it falls in the gas becomes incredibly hot, so hot that it emits X-rays
  (which is how it was discovered). Some of that gas doesn&#x27;t fall into the black
  hole but instead is shot out as &#x27;jets&#x27; of hot gas. The jet itself isn&#x27;t
  visible in this image but you can see the bowshock, the bluish umbrella-like shape
  at the top center of the image, that is produced when gas in the jet collides with
  other gas in the nebula. The bright orange gas to the left is the western edge of
  an emission nebula called Sharpless 101 (Sh2-101). The image was generated with
  observations in Hydrogen alpha (red) and Sulphur [S II] (blue) filters. In this

description: 'This is a Hubble Heritage image created by current and former NOAO staff
  members. The text is modified from the STScI press release, number STScI-PRC00-34
  (Heritage). NGC6745 in the constellation of Lyra is a striking example of a galaxy-galaxy
  collision. A large spiral galaxy, with its nucleus still intact, has interacted
  with a smaller passing galaxy (nearly out of the field of view at lower right),
  where bright blue and bright whitish-blue features show the distinct path taken
  during the smaller galaxy&#x27;s journey. These galaxies did not merely interact
  gravitationally as they passed one another, they actually collided. When galaxies
  collide, the stars that normally comprise the major portion of the luminous mass
  of each of the two galaxies will almost never collide with each other, but will
  pass rather freely between each other with little damage. This occurs because the
  physical size of individual stars is tiny compared to their typical separations,
  making the chance of physical encounter relatively small. In our own Milky Way galaxy,
  the space between our Sun and our nearest stellar neighbor, Proxima Centauri (part
  of the Alpha Centauri triple system), is a vast 4.3 light-years. However, the situation
  is quite different for the interstellar media in the above two galaxies - material
  consisting largely of clouds of atomic and molecular gases and of tiny particles
  of matter and dust, strongly coupled to the gas. Wherever the interstellar clouds
  of the two galaxies collide, they do not freely move past each other without interruption
  but, rather, suffer a damaging collision. High relative velocities cause ram pressures
  at the surface of contact between the interacting interstellar clouds. This pressure,
  in turn, produces material densities sufficiently extreme as to trigger star formation
  through gravitational collapse. The hot blue stars in this image are evidence of
  this star formation. This image was created by the Hubble Heritage Team using NASA
  Hubble Space Telescope archive data taken with the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2
  in March 1996. Members of the science team, which include Roger Lynds (KPNO/NOAO)
  and Earl J. O&#x27;Neil, Jr. (Steward Obs.), used infrared, red, visual and ultraviolet
  filters to image this galaxy system. Lynds and O&#x27;Neil are currently using the
  Hubble data along with ground-based radio observations to further study the interactions
  within NGC6745. Image Credit: NASA and The Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/AURA) Acknowledgement:

description: This excellent image of the Dumbbell Nebula (M27, NGC6853), a planetary
  nebula in the constellation of Vulpecula, was taken at the 3.5-meter WIYN telescope
  using the mini-mosaic imager (described in an NOAO newsletter article). The nebula
  was formed when an evolved, red giant star ejected its outer envelope near the end
  of its lifetime. The expanding cloud of gas becomes visible once the hot core of
  the star, visible near the center, is exposed and the high-energy, ultraviolet light
  from the core causes the cloud to fluoresce. As a result, the cloud emits light
  at discrete wavelengths resulting in an emission-line spectrum. The strongest of
  these lines at visible wavelengths are those of singly and doubly ionized Oxygen
  (372.7 nm, OII, and 500.7 nm, OIII, respectively) and Hydrogen (656.3 nm, H alpha).
  This color image was obtained by combining three separate pictures, each one taken
  through a narrow filter centered at these wavelengths, choosing red to be H alpha
  (30 minute exposure), green to be OIII (30 minutes) and blue to be OII (60 minutes).
  The combination produces an unusual, semi-realistic image of the Dumbbell Nebula
  (see also the more usual color image from the Mayall 4-meter telescope, the nice
  deep image from the 2.1-meter telescope, and another WIYN image including neutral
  Oxygen). The green regions indicate locations within the gas cloud where the highest
  energy radiation is absorbed and doubly ionized Oxygen is present. In contrast,
  regions that are predominantly blue and red indicate where lower energy radiation
  is being absorbed and the line from doubly ionized Oxygen is weaker compared with
  those of singly ionized Oxygen (blue) and Hydrogen (red). Since the hot central
  star emits the same spectrum in all directions, these differences are thought to
  originate from variations in the density of the expanding cloud. The Dumbbell nebula
  is about 850 light-years away from Earth and about 1.5 light-years in diameter (although
  both distance and size are very poorly constrained).

  of hot blue massive stars and several famous nebulae in impressive detail. NGC6822
  is located approximately 1.6 million light-years from Earth, in the constellation
  Sagittarius. A member of the Milky Way galaxy&#x27;s Local Group, it was discovered
  by E.E. Barnard in the early 1880s. Edwin P. Hubble conducted the first detailed
  investigation of the galaxy in 1925, using the new 100-inch telescope on Mount Wilson.
  An analysis of these plates by then-graduate student Susan E. Kayser in 1966 has
  remained the most complete study of this galaxy until now. New images of NGC6822
  in eight filters were taken using the National Science Foundation&#x27;s Blanco
  4-meter telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) near La Serena,
  Chile, by CTIO staff members Knut Olsen and Chris Smith. They, along with Phil Massey
  [PI, Lowell Observatory], Paul Hodge (Univ Washington), Shay Holmes (Lowell Obs),
  George Jacoby (WIYN), Nichole King (STScI), and Abi Saha (NOAO) comprise the &quot;Local

  Travis Rector (NRAO), by combining images taken in seven of the eight filters: U
  (violet), B (blue), V (green), R (orange), I (red), Hydrogen-Alpha (red) and Oxygen
  [OIII] (blue). The images were obtained as part of the NOAO Local Group Galaxies
