description: 'This deep-field image shows what is known as a supercluster of galaxies
  — a giant group of galaxy clusters which are themselves clustered together. This
  one, known as Abell 901/902, comprises three separate main clusters and a number
  of filaments of galaxies, typical of such super-structures. One cluster, Abell 901a,
  can be seen above and just to the right of the prominent red foreground star near
  the middle of the image. Another, Abell 901b, is further to the right of Abell 901a,
  and slightly lower. Finally, the cluster Abell 902 is directly below the red star,
  towards the bottom of the image. The Abell 901/902 supercluster is located a little
  over two billion light-years from Earth, and contains hundreds of galaxies in a
  region about 16 million light-years across. For comparison, the Local Group of galaxies
  — which contains our Milky Way among more than 50 others — measures roughly ten
  million light-years across. This image was taken by the Wide Field Imager (WFI)
  camera on the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope, located at the La Silla Observatory in
  Chile. Using data from the WFI and from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, in
  2008 astronomers were able to precisely map the distribution of dark matter in the
  supercluster, showing that the clusters and individual galaxies which comprise the
  super-structure reside within vast clumps of dark matter. To do this, astronomers
  looked at how the light from 60 000 faraway galaxies located behind the supercluster
  was being distorted by the gravitational influence of the dark matter it contains,
  thus revealing its distribution. The mass of the four main dark matter clumps of
  Abell 901/902 is thought to be around ten trillion times that of the Sun. The observations
  shown here are part of the COMBO-17 survey, a survey of the sky undertaken in 17
  different optical filters using the WFI camera. The COMBO-17 project has so far
  found over 25 000 galaxies. Links  The COMBO-17 survey at the Max-Planck-Institut

description: The Milky Way contains many regions of starbirth — areas where new stars
  are springing to life within collapsing clumps of gas and dust. One such region,
  named Gum 26, is shown here as imaged by the FORS instrument on ESO’s Very Large
  Telescope in Chile. Gum 26 is located roughly 20,000 light-years away in the southern
  constellation of Vela (The Sails). It is something known as an HII region or  emission
  nebula, where the intense ultraviolet radiation streaming from newly-formed stars
  ionises the surrounding hydrogen gas, causing it to emit a faint pinkish glow. By
  catching new stars “pink-handed” in this manner, astronomers can learn more about
  the conditions under which stars arise, and study how they influence their cosmic
  environment.  This image was created as part of the ESO Cosmic Gems programme, an
  outreach initiative to produce images of interesting, intriguing or visually attractive
  objects using ESO telescopes, for the purposes of education and public outreach.
  The programme makes use of telescope time that cannot be used for science observations.
  All data collected may also be suitable for scientific purposes, and are made available
  to astronomers through ESO’s science archive.

description: This image is a color-coded picture of the archetypal starburst galaxy
  M82. It shows the horizontal stellar disk of the galaxy, which harbors its active
  star formation, and a perpendicular supergalactic wind of ionized gas powered by
  the energy released in the starburst. To make this image, data from the WIYN 3.5-meter
  telescope on Kitt Peak were combined with data from the WFPC2 camera on the Hubble
  Space Telescope. Purple represents emission in ionized hydrogen (H-alpha) and ionized
  nitrogen, and the green is ionized sulfur in the WIYN data. In the HST image, these
  colors refer to H-alpha and nitrogen separately. Note the varying angular resolution
  of the dust lanes in the central part of the superwind on either side of the stellar
  disk. These data are being used in a study of the connection between structures
  within M82 and its galactic superwind. This image was first presented at the “Essential
  Science in Hubble’s Final Years” symposium, held 3-6 May 2004 at the Space Telescope
  Science Institute. The WIYN 3.5-meter and 0.9-meter telescopes on Kitt Peak are
  operated by a consortium of the University of Wisconsin, Indiana University, Yale
  University, and the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO).

description: Sextans B is an irregular dwarf galaxy, meaning that it is irregularly
  shaped and smaller than our galaxy, the Milky Way. It lies around 4.5 million light-years
  from Earth and is located in the constellation Sextans in the southern sky. Captured
  with the Nicholas U. Mayall 4-meter Telescope, this image of Sextans B features
  red-colored star-forming regions near the galaxy’s center. Surrounding the galaxy
  are several bright stars that are located much closer to us in our galaxy, identified
  by the crisscross patterns created by light interacting with the structure of the
  telescope, as well as numerous fuzzy-looking background galaxies that appear small
  because they are much farther away than Sextans B.

description: Ten areas in the sky were selected as “deep fields” that the Dark Energy
  Camera imaged several times during the survey, providing a glimpse of distant galaxies
  and helping determine their 3D distribution in the cosmos. The image is teeming
  with galaxies — in fact, nearly every single object in this image is a galaxy. Some
  exceptions include a couple of dozen asteroids as well as a few handfuls of foreground
  stars in our own Milky Way.

description: Composite image of the Cigar Galaxy (also called M82), a starburst galaxy
  about 12 million light-years away in the constellation Ursa Major. The magnetic
  field detected by SOFIA, shown as streamlines, appears to follow the bipolar outflows
  (red) generated by the intense nuclear starburst. The image combines visible starlight
  (gray) and a tracing of hydrogen gas (red) from the Kitt Peak Observatory, with
  near-infrared and mid-infrared starlight and dust (yellow) from SOFIA and the Spitzer
  Space Telescope.
