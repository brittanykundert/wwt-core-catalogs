description: 'Image showing a unique, wide-field infrared view of the region around
  IRAS 16362-4845, an &quot;emission&quot; nebula that shines by its own light. It
  is situated within a dark cloud in a Milky Way region (the &quot;RCW 108 complex&quot;)
  at a distance of about 4,000 light-years in the direction of the Southern constellation
  of Ara (the Altar). The dark cloud is seen silhouetted against the rich background
  of stars in the Milky Way, whose light is blocked by the dust particles in the cloud.
  The photo is based on approx. 600 individual exposures with the SOFI  instrument
  at the 3.58-m ESO New Technology Telescope (NTT). The field-of-view measures about
  13 x 13 arcmin^2, coresponding to 17 x 17 light-years^2. Technical information:
  this image was obtained in February 2000 by means of SOFI, the infrared camera and
  spectrograph at the ESO 3.58-m New Technology Telescope (NTT). The image is a mosaic
  that was prepared by combining 33 overlapping frames, taken in each of the J (wavelength
  1.25 µm; here rendered as blue), H (1.65 µm; green) and K (2.2 µm; red) infrared
  filters. Each individual frame is in turn a stack of six frames totaling 12 sec
  exposure time, with the exception of the one covering the center of the region which
  is 15 times longer in order to increase the sensitivity around the central emission
  nebula (an HII region). The total area imaged is 12.8 x 12.8 arcmin^2, using SOFI
  in its normal resolution mode with 0.29 arcsec pixels and a field of about 5 arcmin.
  Thus the field shown here is about 6.6 times the field-of-view in a single SOFI
  frame. Five-sigma detection limits in the least-exposed areas of the image are typically
  J=18.6, H=17.7, K=17.2 mag. The image quality is between 0.6 and 0.7 arcsec for
  the different filters over most of the field. North is up and East is left.'

  the planets apart from stars, brown dwarfs and other objects in this region of the

  be impossible to image, but shortly after formation they emit a faint glow that

description: The globular cluster Messier 4 (M4 for short) is located about 6,000
  light-years away. On the sky, it is seen in the southern constellation Scorpius,
  It is an ensemble of about 500,000 stars, held together by their mutual gravitational
  pull. There are about 150 such clusters in our Galaxy, and M4 is the one closest
  to us. This colour picture has been obtained by combining three images taken through
  three different filters at the wavelengths of blue, green, and red light. They were
  obtained during the night of May 22, 1998. In this way, the stars are seen in their
  true colours, ranging from blue for very hot stars (about 10,000 degrees) to red
  for the cooler ones (about 4,000 degrees). With an exposure time of only 2 minutes,
  the VLT has been able to detect in the blue light stars as faint as magnitude 24.
  This corresponds to 15 million times dimmer than the faintest stars visible to the
  naked eye. This was achieved even though the image has a fairly high background,
  being taken with the Moon above the horizon (3 days before New Moon, with 18% illumination).
  The large mirror surface of the VLT UT1 (53 m 2 ) and its ability to produce very
  sharp images (measured as 0.53 arcsec on these images), unequalled by any ground-based

  offsets ; this ensures that the complete field is well covered. This procedure is
  not simple, as the observing conditions may change slightly from exposure to exposure,
  resulting in small differences. Finally, the combined images in each filter are
  aligned and colour-coded to produce the colour picture.  For the processing of this
  large photo (8k x 8k; 256 Mbytes), a minimum of contrast correction was made and
  very faint lines may still be perceived in some places where the individual frames
  were joined. It may also be noted that there is a slight misalignment of the individual

  the final, powerful burst of light emitted by the explosion of a star. Though shy
  to lesser telescopes, the galaxy cannot hide from ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT)
  at Cerro Paranal, Chile. The image was obtained using the VIsible MultiObject Spectrograph

description: 'This new picture from the VLT Survey Telescope (VST) at ESO&#x27;s Paranal
  Observatory shows the remarkable super star cluster Westerlund 1 (eso1034). This
  exceptionally bright cluster lies about 16 000 light-years from Earth in the southern
  constellation of Ara (The Altar). It contains hundreds of very massive and brilliant
  stars, all of which are just a few million years old — babies by stellar standards.
  But our view of this cluster is hampered by gas and dust that prevents most of the
  visible light from the cluster&#x27;s stars from getting to Earth. Now, astronomers
  studying images of Westerlund 1 from a new survey of the southern skies [1] have
  spotted something unexpected in this cluster. Around one of the stars — known as
  W26, a red supergiant and possibly the biggest star known— they have discovered
  clouds of glowing hydrogen gas, shown as green features in this new image. Such
  glowing clouds around massive stars are very rare, and are even rarer around a red
  supergiant— this is the first ionised nebula discovered around such a star. W26
  itself would be too cool to make the gas glow; the astronomers speculate that the
  source of the ionising radiation may be either hot blue stars elsewhere in the cluster,
  or possibly a fainter, but much hotter, companion star to W26. W26 will eventually
  explode as a supernova. The nebula that surrounds it is very similar to the nebula
  surrounding SN1987A, the remnants of a star that went supernova in 1987 [2]. SN1987A
  was the closest observed supernova to Earth since 1604, and as such it gave astronomers
  a chance to explore the properties of these explosions. Studying objects like this
  new nebula around W26 will help astronomers to understand the mass loss processes
  around these massive stars, which eventually lead to their explosive demise. Notes
  [1] This picture forms part of a detailed public survey of a large part of the Milky
  Way called VPHAS+ that is using the power of the VST to search for new objects such
  as young stars and planetary nebulae. A spectacular recent picture of the Prawn
  Nebula was made using observations from the same survey. [2] This nebula is thought
  to have surrounded SN1987A’s progenitor star since before it went supernova. Links  Research

description: This image shows a region of the Milky Way that lies within the constellation
  of Scorpius, close to the central plane of the galaxy. The region hosts a dense
  cloud of dust and gas associated with the molecular cloud IRAS 16562-3959, clearly
  visible as an orange smudge among the rich pool of stars at the centre of the image.
  Clouds like these are breeding grounds for new stars. In the centre of this cloud
  the bright object known as G345.4938+01.4677 can just be seen beyond the veil of
  gas and dust. This is a very young star in the process of forming as the cloud collapses
  under gravity. The young star is very bright and heavy —  roughly 15 times more
  massive than the Sun — and featured in a recent Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
  Array (ALMA) result. The team of astronomers made surprising discoveries within
  G345.4938+01.4677 — there is a large disc of gas and dust around the forming star
  as well as a stream of material flowing out from it. Theories predict that neither
  such a stream, nor the disc itself, are likely to exist around stars like G345.4938+01.4677
  because the strong radiation from such massive new stars is thought to push material
  away. This image was made using the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy
  (VISTA), which is part of ESO’s Paranal Observatory in the Atacama Desert of Chile.
  It is the world’s largest survey telescope, with a main mirror that measures over
  four metres across. The colour image was produced by the VVV survey, which is one
  of six large public surveys that are devoted to mapping the southern sky. The bright
  star in the bottom left of the image is known as HD 153220.

description: This beautiful image, captured with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
  Array (ALMA) features a protoplanetary disc surrounding the young star Elias 2-27,
  some 450 light years away. ALMA has discovered and observed plenty of protoplanetary
  discs, but this disc is special as it shows two distinct spiral arms, almost like
  a tiny version of a spiral galaxy. Previously, astronomers noted compelling spiral
  features on the surfaces of protoplanetary discs, but it was unknown if these same
  spiral patterns also emerged deep within the disc where planet formation takes place.
  ALMA, for the first time, was able to peer deep into the mid-plane of a disk and
  discovered the clear signature of spiral density waves. Nearest to the star, ALMA
  found a flat disc of dust, which extends to what would approximately be the orbit
  of Neptune in our own Solar System. Beyond that point, in the region analogous to
  our Kuiper Belt, ALMA detected a narrow band with significantly less dust, which
  may be an indication for planet in formation. Springing from the outer edge of this
  gap are the two sweeping spiral arms that extend more than 10 billion kilometers
  away from their host star. The discovery of spiral waves at these extreme distances
  may have implications on the theory of planet formation.

description: 'Nestled in the young Ophiuchus star-forming region, 410 light-years
  from the Sun, a fascinating protoplanetary disc named AS 209 is slowly being carved
  into shape. This wonderful image was captured using the high-resolution ALMA telescope,
  revealing a curious pattern of rings and gaps in the dust surrounding a young star.
  Protoplanetary discs are dense, rotating planes of gas and dust that surround newly
  formed stars; providing the matter that one day becomes orbiting planets, moons
  and other minor bodies. At less than one million years old, this system is very
  young, but already two clear gaps are being sculpted from the disc. The outer gap
  is deep, wide, and largely a dust-free zone, leading astronomers to believe that
  a giant planet almost the mass of Saturn is orbiting here — around 800 light-minutes
  from the central star, and more than three times the distance between Neptune and
  the Sun! As the planet carves out its path, dust piles up at the outer edge of its
  orbit, creating ever more defined rings in the disc. The thinner, inner dust gap
  could have been formed by a smaller planet, but astronomers have raised the intriguing
  possibility that the large and distant circling planet in fact created both paths.
  This inferred Saturn-like planet so far from its central star raises fascinating
  questions about planet formation at the edges of protoplanetary discs on particularly
  short timescales. Link:  Research paper '

description: This spectacular Picture of the Week was produced from data gathered
  by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile, combined with
  data from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. It shows a cluster of stars named
  Westerlund 1, one of the most massive young star clusters known to reside in the
  Milky Way. Excitingly, it also shows the comet-like “tails” of material stretching
  away from some of the giant stars in Westerlund 1. Such tails are formed in the
  thick, relentless winds that pour from the cluster’s stellar residents, carrying
  material outwards. This phenomenon is similar to how comets get their famous and
  beautiful tails. Comet tails in the Solar System are driven away from the nucleus
  of their parent comet by a wind of particles that streams out from the Sun. Consequently
  comet tails always point away from our Sun. Similarly, the tails of the huge red
  stars shown in this image point away from the core of the cluster, likely the result
  of powerful cluster winds generated by the hundreds of hot and massive stars found
  towards the centre of Westerlund 1. These massive structures cover large distances
  and indicate the dramatic effect the environment can have on how the stars form
  and evolve. These comet-like tails were detected during an ALMA study of Westerlund
  1 that aimed to explore the cluster’s constituent stars and figure out how, and
  at what rate, they lose their mass. The cluster is known to host a large amount
  of massive stars, many of them intriguing and rare types, making it of great interest
  and use to astronomers wishing to understand the myriad stars in our galaxy.

description: 'This week’s Picture of the Week focuses on one of twenty protoplanetary
  discs explored and imaged by ALMA’s first Large Program, known as the Disk Substructures
  at High Angular Resolution Project (DSHARP). The disc is called AS 209, and its
  substructures are particularly pronounced thanks to its thin, high-contrast rings
  and almost face-on orientation towards us. Though concentric rings — shown here
  in particularly beautiful clarity — are a common substructure among such discs,
  their widths, separations, and number can vary greatly. It’s still unclear how these
  substructures form, and how planets emerge from them. Quantifying and studying these
  similarities and differences was a motivator for constructing ALMA, and was the
  main objective of DSHARP. These details may hold clues to the type of planetary
  system that will eventually emerge. One interpretation is that there may be a rapid
  and complex interplay between young protoplanets and the disc itself far earlier
  in the evolution of the planetary system than previously thought. A leading theory
  of planet formation requires dust within these discs to clump into grains, then
  pebbles, and eventually planetesimals. This theory has always been stumped, however,
  by the fact that once an object reaches a certain mass, the dynamics of these discs
  would cause it to be sucked into the host star at the centre, thus halting its growth
  into a true planet. The results from the DSHARP program suggest that disc substructures
  may perturb these dynamics and provide safe havens where young planetesimals can
  continue growing — making the substructures observed here crucial to our own existence.
  Next week’s picture will be the final instalment in the DSHARP series, and will
  showcase another of the twenty images: this time a multiple star system.'

description: This week’s Picture of the Week highlights another of the 20 images to
  come out of ALMA’s first Large Program, the Disk Substructures at High Angular Resolution
  Project (DSHARP). DSHARP explored a number of nearby protoplanetary discs to learn
  more about the earliest stages of planet formation, and a staggering quantity of
  data from the project has just been released. This object, called AS 205, is notable
  for being a multiple star system, one of two such systems imaged by DSHARP (the
  other being HT Lup). While two discs are discernible here, the lower right disc
  is in fact shared by two stars in a binary system, so we are actually looking at
  a system of three fledgling stars. Although most high-resolution studies have so
  far focused on single stars, multiple systems are far from uncommon in the Universe.
  It is thought that over half of all stars may exist in multiple systems, an estimate
  that may be even higher for young stars. The presence of companion stars is likely
  to have complex implications for a disc and its substructures. This is due to as
  the gravitational influence of a stellar neighbour, which may distort and redistribute
  the material within the disc. Data from AS 205 and HT Lup indicate that stars and
  their neighbouring discs interact strongly. Despite their unsettled birth environments,
  planets have been detected in multiple stellar systems — some orbiting just one
  of the stars, others orbiting the entire system. The latter are more likely to have
  stable orbits than the former, which get caught up in volatile interstellar dynamics.

description: 'Using the detailed eyes of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
  Array (ALMA) and ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT), astronomers have mapped the intense
  tails of a cosmic jellyfish: a number of knotty streams of gas spewing outwards
  from a spiral galaxy named ESO 137-001. This celestial cnidarian is shown here in
  beautiful detail. The various elements making up this image were captured by different
  telescopes. The galaxy and its surroundings were imaged by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space
  Telescope; its tails, which trace streams of hydrogen and show up in hues of bright
  purple, by the MUSE instrument mounted on the VLT; and bright hotspots of carbon
  oxide emission from within the system, which show up as flares of orange-red, were
  spotted by ALMA. These tails are caused by a dramatic phenomenon known as ram-pressure
  stripping. The space between galaxies in a cluster is not empty, but full of material
  that acts like a viscous fluid. As a galaxy travels through this resistant environment,
  gas is stripped out of the galaxy to form a wake that creates beautiful, intricate
  systems such as that seen here around ESO 137-001 (which resides in the Norma galaxy
  cluster). The direction and position of the tail shed light on the way in which
  the galaxy is moving — with galaxies usually falling towards the centre of the cluster
  itself. This image offers the first high-resolution map of the cold molecular gas
  lurking within a ram-pressure stripped system. ESO 137-001 is one of the nearest
  jellyfish galaxies to Earth, and is particularly interesting because its long, extended
  tails of gas contain features known as ‘fireballs’: bursts of star formation. The
  precise mechanisms governing how stars form within jellyfish tails are mysterious,
  and this map thus provides a new window onto the conditions needed for new stars
  to form in such intense, changeable environments.  The ALMA array comprises 66 antennas,
  and is located on the Chajinator plateau in the Chilean Atacama Desert at an altitude
  of 5000 metres. ALMA observes the night sky from this remote location to unlock
  the secrets of how the Universe — and its weird and wonderful residents, ESO 137-001
  included — formed and evolved, revealing more about our cosmic origins.'
