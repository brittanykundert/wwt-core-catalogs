description: 'Colour composite image of the sky field around the position of the gamma-ray
  burst GRB 000131 that was detected on January 31, 2000. It is based on images obtained
  with the ESO Very Large Telescope at Paranal. The object is indicated with an arrow,
  near a rather bright star (magnitude 9, i.e., over 1 million times brighter than
  the faintest objects visible on this photo). This and other bright objects in the
  field are responsible for various unavoidable imaging effects, caused by optical
  reflections (ring-shaped &quot;ghost images&quot;, e.g. to the left of the brightest
  star) and detector saturation effects (horizontal and vertical straight lines and
  coloured &quot;coronae&quot; at the bright objects, and areas of &quot;bleeding&quot;,
  e.g. below the bright star). Technical information: The photo is based on three
  8-min exposures obtained with VLT ANTU and the multi-mode FORS1 instrument. The
  optical filters were B (seeing 0.9 arcsec; here rendered as blue), V (0.8 arcsec;
  green) and R (0.7 arcsec; red). The field measures 6.8 x 6.8 arcmin 2. North is

description: 'It’s one of the closest galaxies to Earth, but the Carina Dwarf Galaxy
  is so dim and diffuse that astronomers only discovered it in the 1970s. A companion
  galaxy of the Milky Way, this ball of stars shares features with both globular star
  clusters and much larger galaxies. Astronomers believe that dwarf spheroidal galaxies
  like the Carina Dwarf are very common in the Universe, but they are extremely difficult
  to observe. Their faintness and low star density mean that it is easy to simply
  see right through them. In this image, the Carina Dwarf appears as many faint stars
  scattered across most of the central part of the picture. It is hard to tell apart
  stars from the dwarf galaxy, foreground stars within the Milky Way and even faraway
  galaxies that poke through the gaps: the Carina Dwarf is a master of cosmic camouflage.
  The Carina Dwarf’s stars show an unusual spread of ages. They appear to have formed
  in a series of bursts, with quiet periods lasting several billion years in between
  them. It lies around 300 000 light-years from Earth, which places it further away
  than the Magellanic Clouds (the nearest galaxies to the Milky Way), but significantly
  closer to us than the Andromeda Galaxy, the closest spiral galaxy. So, despite being
  small for a galaxy, its proximity to Earth means that the Carina Dwarf appears quite
  large in the sky, just under half the size of the full Moon — albeit very much fainter.
  This makes it fit comfortably within the field of view of ESO’s Wide Field Imager,
  an instrument designed for making observations of large parts of the sky. Although
  this image in itself is not so striking, it is likely the best image of the Carina
  Dwarf Galaxy to date. The image was made using observations from the Wide Field
  Imager on the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope at La Silla, and from the Victor M. Blanco
  4-metre telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory.'

description: This image shows the swirling shape of galaxy NGC 2217, in the constellation
  of Canis Major (The Great Dog). In the central region of the galaxy is a distinctive
  bar of stars within an oval ring. Further out, a set of tightly wound spiral arms
  almost form a circular ring around the galaxy. NGC 2217 is therefore classified
  as a barred spiral galaxy, and its circular appearance indicates that we see it
  nearly face-on. The outer spiral arms have a bluish colour, indicating the presence
  of hot, luminous, young stars, born out of clouds of interstellar gas. The central
  bulge and bar are yellower in appearance, due to the presence of older stars. Dark
  streaks can also be seen in places against the galaxy’s arms and central bulge,
  where lanes of cosmic dust block out some of the starlight. The majority of spiral
  galaxies in the local Universe — including our own Milky Way — are thought to have
  a bar of some kind, and these structures play an important role in the development
  of a galaxy. They can, for example, funnel gas towards the centre of the galaxy,
  helping to feed a central black hole, or to form new stars.

description: 'Astronomers spend their time gazing out into the Universe — and occasionally
  the Universe seems to peer right back! This image, a composite of data from the
  Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the NASA/ESA Hubble Space
  Telescope, shows a very rare cosmic sight: a pair of interacting galaxies that have
  taken on an ocular structure. As the name suggests, some types of grazing encounters
  between galaxies create shapes that resemble the human eye. While galaxy collisions
  of this type are not uncommon, only a few galaxies with eye-like, or ocular, structures
  have been observed. The paucity of these features is likely due to their very ephemeral
  nature — ocular structures like these tend to only last for several tens of millions
  of years, which is merely the blink of an eye in a galactic lifetime. These two
  galaxies are named IC 2163 (left) and NGC 2207 (right) — IC 2163 displays the ocular
  structure in this image. The duo lies approximately 114 million light-years from
  Earth in the direction of the constellation of Canis Major (The Greater Dog). The
  galaxies have brushed past each other — scraping the outer edges of their spiral
  arms —with IC 2163 passing behind NGC 2207. This glancing collision triggered a
  tsunami of stars and gas in IC 2163, with material in the outer portions of the
  disc of the  galaxy travelling inwards  This colossal wave of material decelerated
  rapidly moving from the outer to the inner edge of the eyelids and crashed midway
  through the galaxy’s disc, producing dazzling ribbons of intense star formation
  and compressed ridges of gas and dust that resemble a pair of cosmic “eyelids”.

description: This colourful image shows a part of the Rosette Nebula in the constellation
  of Monoceros (The Unicorn). It is an emission nebula, composed of clouds of gas
  that are made to glow by the radiation emanating from stars within. The Rosette
  Nebula is a fairly typical example of an emission nebula — but typical does not
  mean boring! Nebulae are some of the most beautiful celestial objects out there,
  and they frequently show up spectacularly in images taken by astronomical telescopes,
  as seen here. In nebulae such as this, gas and dust are combining to produce a new
  generation of stars. Initially these newly-formed stars are shrouded in the dusty
  clouds that gave them birth, and cannot be seen in visible light. But after a while
  they blow away the denser material and their powerful radiation pours out to ionise
  the surrounding gas, causing it to glow brightly. These elements are all present
  in this image — the mixture of glowing gas and dark dust has been sculpted into
  complex patterns on the sky by the stellar radiation, like smoke around a fire.
  This particular image was obtained with the FORS 2 instrument on ESO’s Very Large
  Telescope, sited in the harsh environment of Chile’s Atacama Desert. FORS 2 is an
  extremely versatile instrument that can produce very high-quality images (like this
  one!). It is also a spectrograph that can split the light it collects into a rainbow
  of colours, giving astronomers information about the chemical composition of objects
  across the Universe. This image was created as part of the ESO Cosmic Gems programme,
  an outreach initiative to produce images of interesting, intriguing or visually
  attractive objects using ESO telescopes, for the purposes of education and public
  outreach. The programme makes use of telescope time that cannot be used for science
  observations. All data collected may also be suitable for scientific purposes, and
  are made available to astronomers through ESO’s science archive.

description: This wide-field image of the Christmas Tree Cluster was taken at the
  National Science Foundation&#x27;s 0.9-meter telescope on Kitt Peak with the NOAO
  Mosaic CCD camera. Also known as NGC2264, it is an open cluster of stars embedded
  in a diffuse nebula. It is located in the constellation of Monoceros, the Unicorn.
  The image also contains two famous nebula. At the bottom center of the image is
  the Cone Nebula, and to the upper left is the Fox Fur Nebula. The bright star just
  above the center of the image is known as S Mon. The gentle arcs in orange and blue
  near the center of the image are Herbig Haro objects, jets of gas from protostars
  embedded in the nebula. In this image north is up and east is to the right. This
  image was created by combining emission-line images in Hydrogen-alpha (red-orange),
  Oxygen [O III] (light blue) and Sulfur [S II] (blue-violet).

description: This image of Hubble&#x27;s Variable Nebula in the constellation of Monoceros
  was taken with the Kitt Peak National Observatory&#x27;s 0.9-meter telescope in
  March 1995. This deep version of the image shows the faint tail extending down to
  the south from the nebula. To the north, almost directly above the nebula, is a
  cluster of faint red dots comprising the Herbig Haro object known as HH39. This
  object shows strong emission lines, especially those of hydrogen and nitrogen (which
  provide the red color), and gets its energy from a strong outflow, or jet, emitted
  by R Monocerotis, which is the young star at the southern end of NGC2261. A shallower
  realization shows the interior details of the nebula.

description: The Rosette Nebula in the constellation Monoceros. This image, despite

  nebula. This color picture was made from CCD images taken in September 1997 at the
  Burrell Schmidt telescope of the Warner and Swasey Observatory of the Case Western
  Reserve University, located on Kitt Peak in southwestern Arizona. The image is rather
  fuzzy, as the weather conditions gave rather poor seeing, and there is a low level
  noise pattern due to an electrical problem with the CCD imager. As a result, the
  high resolution version is not really of much use, but it is included for completeness.
  This image will be replaced when a better one becomes available.

description: This stunning emission-line image of the Rosette nebula (NGC2237) has

  found in the constellation Monoceros (the Unicorn). This images was taken at the
  National Science Foundation&#x27;s 0.9-m telescope on Kitt Peak with the Mosaic
  camera, and is presented here in false color (hydrogen alpha, OIII oxygen, and SII
  sulfur respectively red, green and blue, using five ten-minute exposures each).
  The Rosette is a prominent star formation region, glowing due to ultraviolet light
  from the young, hot, blue stars whose winds also cleared the central hole. It is
  enormously large on the sky, covering more than six times the area of the full moon.
  An approximately true color version at lower resolution from the Schmidt telescope
  is also available.
