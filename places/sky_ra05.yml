description: This is the central region of the Crab Nebula, the famous supernova remnant

  Light&quot; with the third 8.2-m VLT Unit Telescope, MELIPAL. It is a composite
  of several 30-sec exposures with the VLT Test Camera in three broad-band filters,
  B (here rendered as blue; most synchrotron emission), V (green) and R (red; mostly
  emission from hydrogen atoms). The Crab Pulsar is visible to the left; it is the
  lower of the two brightest stars near each other. The image quality is about 0.9
  arcsec, and is completely determined by the external seeing caused by the atmospheric
  turbulence above the telescope at the time of the observation. The coloured, vertical
  lines to the left are artifacts of a &quot;bad column&quot; of the CCD. The field
  measures about 1.3 x 1.3 arcmin 2. This image may be compared with that of the same
  area that was obtained earlier with the FORS2 instrument at KUEYEN.  (see  ESO Press

description: A reproduction of a composite colour image of the Tarantula Nebula in
  the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and its surroundings. The LMC is a satellite galaxy
  to our Milky Way system, located in the southern constellation Dorado (the Swordfish)
  at a distance of approximately 170,000 light-years. The image is based on 15 exposures
  in the visual part of the spectrum with the Wide Field Imager (WFI) camera on the
  2.2-m MPG/ESO telescope at the La Silla Observatory. A number of small areas near
  the borders were not covered in all three colours and have been left black. Six
  smaller fields with particular objects from this photo are reproduced as ESO Press
  Photos eso0216b-g.   ESO Press Photo eso0216a  was produced from 15 images that
  were obtained in September 2000 with the Wide-Field-Imager (WFI) at the 2.2-m MPG/ESO
  telescope. The images were exposed in the B-band (5 x 200 sec; wavelength 456 nm;
  Full-Width-Half-Maximum (FWHM) 99 nm; here rendered as blue), V-band (5 x 200 sec;
  540 nm; 89 nm; green) and R-band (5 x 200 sec; 652 nm; 162 nm; red). The original
  pixel size is 0.238 arcsec. The photo shows the full field recorded in all three
  colours. It measures approximately 34 x 34 arcmin 2 ; North is up and East is left.
  The seeing was about 1.6 arcsec.

  with the FORS1 and FORS2 multi-mode instruments (at VLT MELIPAL and YEPUN, respectively).
  Its optical appearance of NGC 1792 is quite chaotic, due to the patchy distribution
  of dust throughout the disc of this galaxy. It is very rich in neutral hydrogen
  gas - fuel for the formation of new stars - and is indeed rapidly forming such stars.
  The galaxy is characterized by unusually luminous far-infrared radiation ; this
  is due to dust heated by young stars. Note the numerous background galaxies in this
  sky field. North is up and East is to the left.

description: ALMA, in which ESO is a partner, and the SPHERE instrument on ESO’s Very
  Large Telescope have imaged GW Orionis, a triple star system with a peculiar inner
  region. Unlike the flat planet-forming discs we see around many stars, GW Orionis
  features a warped disc, deformed by the movements of the three stars at its centre.
  This composite image shows both the ALMA and SPHERE observations of the disc.  The
  ALMA image shows the disc’s ringed structure, with the innermost ring (part of which
  is visible as an oblong dot at the very centre of the image) separated from the
  rest of the disc. The SPHERE observations allowed astronomers to see for the first
  time the shadow of this innermost ring on the rest of the disc, which made it possible
  for them to reconstruct its warped shape.

  000 light-years away in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a Milky Way neighbour. The reddish
  filaments surrounding the cluster, made of vast clouds of hydrogen, are believed
  to be the remnants of supernova explosions.  The image is an overlay of observations
  conducted in visible light with ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) and NASA/ESA’s
  Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The VLT captured the wide field of the image and the
  filaments, while the central cluster was imaged by the HST.   Among many stars,
  this cluster is home to a black hole 11 times as massive as the Sun and to a five-solar-mass
  star orbiting it. By looking at the star’s orbit, a team of astronomers were able
  to infer the presence of the black hole, making it the first small black hole outside
  of our galaxy to be found this way. For this discovery, the team used the Multi
  Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument at the VLT.

  The straight jet emerges from the surrounding interstellar cloud in the lower part
  of the picture. The outline of the cloud is vaguely visible by the brighter background
  near the right edge of the picture. Also seen is a diffuse reflection nebula around
  the lower part of the jet. This nebula is illuminated by the light from the newborn
  star, hidden deep within the cloud. Because of the heavy obscuration, the star itself
  is not visible on this photo. The jet produces a ``bow-shock&#x27;&#x27; nebula;
  this is the bright, mushroom-shaped nebula in the upper part of the picture. The
  round points are background stars in the Milky Way. Compare this image with the
  graphic representation of the jet isophotes, also accompanying this Press Release.
  The picture was produced as a composite of four 1 hour CCD exposures, obtained with
  the Danish 1.5 m telescope at La Silla through a narrow optical filter. The light
  seen here from the jet is emitted by singly ionised sulphur atoms. This photo is

  state of the gas.  Br-gamma traces hydrogen gas that is ionised by the well known
  Trapezium and other hot, young, stars in the region ; the [FeII] emission is emitted
  by high velocity fragments ejected during the birth of new stars in the OMC1 molecular
  cloud. The hollow filaments seen in molecular hydrogen result from shock heating
  of the molecular gas in the wake of the outflowing matter.  In this image, the scale

description: Colour a composite of three individual exposures, taken with FORS1 at
  the VLT UT1 on 3 February 1999. They were obtained through B (blue), V (green),
  and H-alpha (red) filters, and each of them was bias-subtracted and flat-fielded
  before combination. The field-of-view is 6.8 x 6.8 arcmin 2, corresponding to an
  area of just over 300 x 300 light-years 2 at the distance of the Large Magellanic
  Cloud. The exposure times were 60, 60 and 450 seconds and the image quality was
  1.0, 0.7 and 0.8 arcsec (FWHM) for the B, V, and H-alpha frames, respectively. The
  intensity scale is linear for the B and V images and logarithmic for H-alpha, in
  order to enhance the fine structure of the faintest parts of the nebulosity. North
  is 33° to the right of the vertical. It is a composite of blue and green images
  plus an image in the light of Hydrogen. It shows that there is indeed still much
  gas around NGC 1850.  While part of this may well be the remnant of the &quot;parent&quot;
  gas cloud (i.e. the one from which both clusters were born), the presence of filaments
  and of various sharp &quot;shocks&quot;, e.g. to the left and below NGC 1850, offers
  support to the theory of supernova-induced star birth in the younger of the two
  clusters. Some &quot;protostars&quot; are located near or in some of the filaments
  — this is interpreted as additional evidence for that theory.  The nebulosity directly
  above the main cluster, that is shaped like a &quot;3&quot;, is the well-known supernova
  remnant N103B which itself may also be associated with NGC 1850.

description: This image shows a three-colour composite of the N 70  nebula. It is
  a &quot;Super Bubble&quot;  in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a satellite galaxy
  to the Milky Way system, located in the southern sky at a distance of about 160,000
  light-years. This photo is based on CCD frames obtained with the FORS2  instrument

  interstellar gas, measuring about 300 light-years in diameter. It was created by
  winds from hot, massive stars and supernova explosions and the interior is filled
  with tenuous, hot expanding gas. An object like N70 provides astronomers with an
  excellent opportunity to explore the connection between the life-cycles of stars
  and the evolution of galaxies. Very massive stars profoundly affect their environment.
  They stir and mix the interstellar clouds of gas and dust, and they leave their
  mark in the compositions and locations of future generations of stars and star systems.

  70  nebula. It is a &quot;Super Bubble&quot;  in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC),
  a satellite galaxy to the Milky Way system, located in the southern sky at a distance
  of about 160,000 light-years. This photo is based on CCD frames obtained with the
  FORS2  instrument in imaging mode in the morning of November 5, 1999.  N 70 is a
  luminous bubble of interstellar gas, measuring about 300 light-years in diameter.
  It was created by winds from hot, massive stars and supernova explosions and the
  interior is filled with tenuous, hot expanding gas. An object like N70 provides
  astronomers with an excellent opportunity to explore the connection between the
  lifecycles of stars and the evolution of galaxies. Very massive stars profoundly
  affect their environment. They stir and mix the interstellar clouds of gas and dust,
  and they leave their mark in the compositions and locations of future generations
  of stars and star systems.

description: 'This  colourful new view shows the star-forming region LHA 120-N44 [1]
  in the  Large Magellanic Cloud, a small satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. This  picture
  combines the view in visible light from the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre  telescope at ESO’s
  La Silla Observatory in Chile with images in infrared  light and X-rays from orbiting
  satellite observatories. At  the centre of this very rich region of gas, dust and

  matter at high speeds as stellar winds, and race through their  short but brilliant
  lives to explode as supernovae. The winds and  supernova shock waves have carved
  out a huge cavity, called a  superbubble, in the surrounding gas. Observations  with

  giving off  such strong X-rays? The answer seems to be that there are two extra  sources
  of bright X-ray emission: supernova shock waves striking the  walls of the cavities,
  and hot material evaporating from the cavity  walls. This X-ray emission from the

description: The Crab Nebula, which also goes by the names Messier 1, NGC 1952 and
  Taurus A, is one of the best studied astronomical objects in the sky. It is the
  remnant of a supernova explosion which was observed by Chinese astronomers in 1054.
  The tangled filaments visible in this image are the remains of the exploded star,
  which are still expanding outwards at about 1500 kilometres per second. Although
  not visible to the naked eye due to foreground filaments of helium and hydrogen
  the heart of the nebula hosts two faint stars. It is one of these that is responsible
  for the nebula that we see today — a star that is known as the Crab Pulsar, or CM
  Tau. This is the small, dense, corpse of the original star that caused the supernova.
  It is now only about 20 kilometres in diameter and rotates around its axis 30 times
  every second! The star emits pulses of radiation in all wavelengths, ranging from
  gamma rays — for which it is one of the brightest sources in the sky — to radio
  waves. The radiation from the star is so strong that it is creating a wave of material
  that is deforming the inner parts of the nebula. The appearance of these structures
  changes so fast that astronomers can actually observe how they reshape. This provides
  a rare opportunity as cosmic timescales are usually much too long for change to
  be observed to this extent. The data from the Wide Field Imager on the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre
  telescope at ESO’s La Silla Observatory in Chile used to make this image were selected
  from the ESO archive by Manu Mejias as part of the Hidden Treasures competition.

description: A pair of jets protrude outwards in near-perfect symmetry in this image
  of Herbig-Haro object (HH) 212, taken by ESO’s already decommissioned Infrared Spectrometer
  And Array Camera (ISAAC). The object lies in the constellation of Orion (The Hunter)
  in a dense molecular star-forming region, not far from the famous Horsehead Nebula.
  In regions like this, clouds of dust and gas collapse under the force of gravity,
  spinning faster and faster and becoming hotter and hotter until a young star ignites
  at the cloud’s centre. Any leftover material swirling around the newborn protostar
  comes together to form an accretion disc that will, under the right circumstances,
  eventually evolve to form the base material for the creation of planets, asteroids
  and comets. Although this process is still not fully understood, it is common that
  a protostar and its accretion disc, as seen here edge-on, are the cause of the jets
  in this image. The star at the centre of HH 212 is indeed a very young star, at
  only a few thousand years old. Its jets are remarkably symmetric, with several knots
  appearing at relatively stable intervals. This stability suggests that the jet pulses
  vary quite regularly, and over a short timescale — maybe even as short as 30 years!
  Further out from the centre, large bow shocks spread out into interstellar space,
  caused by ejected gas colliding with dust and gas at speeds of several hundred kilometres
  per second.

description: 'Astronomers hunt for planets orbiting other stars (exoplanets) using
  a variety of methods. One successful method is direct imaging; this is particularly
  effective for planets on wide orbits around young stars, because the light from
  the planet is not overwhelmed by light from the host star and is thus easier to
  spot. This image demonstrates this technique. It shows a T-Tauri star named CVSO
  30, located approximately 1200 light-years away from Earth in the 25 Orionis group
  (slightly northwest of Orion’s famous Belt). In 2012, astronomers found that CVSO
  30 hosted one exoplanet (CVSO 30b) using a detection method known as transit photometry,
  where the light from a star observably dips as a planet travels in front of it.
  Now, astronomers have gone back to look at the system using  a number of telescopes.
  The study combines observations obtained with the ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT)
  in Chile, the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, and the Calar Alto Observatory facilities
  in Spain. Using the data astronomers have imaged what is likely to be a second planet!
  To produce the image, astronomers exploited the astrometry provided by VLT’s NACO
  and SINFONI instruments. This new exoplanet, named CVSO 30c, is the small dot to
  the upper left of the frame (the large blob is the star itself). While the previously-detected
  planet, CVSO 30b, orbits very close to the star, whirling around CVSO 30 in just
  under 11 hours at an orbital distance of 0.008 au, CVSO 30c orbits significantly
  further out, at a distance of 660 au, taking a staggering 27 000 years to complete
  a single orbit. (For reference, the planet Mercury orbits the Sun at an average
  distance of 0.39 au, while Neptune sits at just over 30 au.) If it is confirmed
  that CVSO 30c orbits CVSO 30, this would be the first star system to host both a
  close-in exoplanet detected by the transit method and a far-out exoplanet detected
  by direct imaging. Astronomers are still exploring how such an exotic system came
  to form in such a short timeframe, as the star is only 2.5 million years old; it
  is possible that the two planets interacted at some point in the past, scattering
  off one another and settling in their current extreme orbits. Link:  Research paper

  in more than 400 years. The stellar explosion, SN 1987A, blazed with the power of
  100 million suns for several months after its discovery on 23 February 1987. Located
  in the Large Magellanic Cloud, one of the Milky Way’s satellite galaxies, SN 1987A
  was the nearest supernova explosion observed in centuries and it quickly became
  the best studied supernova of all time. Over the last thirty years, detailed follow-up
  observations with telescopes both in space and on the ground have allowed astronomers
  to study the death throes of a massive star in unprecedented detail, from star to
  supernova to supernova remnant, revolutionising our understanding of these explosive
  events. With its superb sensitivity at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths,
  the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has been exploring previously
  unstudied aspects of SN 1987A since 2013. Astronomers are using ALMA to observe
  the glowing remains of the supernova in high resolution, studying how the remnant
  is making vast amounts of dust from the new elements created in the progenitor star.
  A portion of this dust will make its way into interstellar space and may one day
  be the material from which future planets around other stars are made. These observations

description: This intriguing image may look like a collection of coloured blobs, but
  it is actually a high-resolution snapshot of a newborn star enshrouded in dust.
  Just 1300 light-years away in the Orion Nebula, the star, named HH 212, is remarkably
  young. The average lifespan of such a low-mass star is around 100 billion years,
  but this star is only 40 000 years old — truly an infant in stellar terms. In the
  cores of the vast molecular clouds in star formation regions, an ongoing battle
  rages; gravity versus the pressure of gas and dust. If gravity wins, it forces the
  gas and dust to collapse into a hot dense core that eventually ignites — forming
  a protostar. All the leftover gas and dust form a spinning disc around this baby
  star, and in many star systems they eventually coalesce to make planets. Such very
  young protostellar discs have been hard to image because of their relatively small
  size, but now the exceedingly high resolution of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
  Array (ALMA) makes it possible to understand the intricate details of star and planet
  formation. A closer look at HH 212 reveals a prominent, cool, dark dust lane running
  through the disc, sandwiched between two brighter regions that are heated by the
  protostar. The result resembles a cosmic “hamburger”. This is the very first time
  astronomers have spotted such a dust lane in the earliest phases of star formation,
  and so it may provide clues as to how planetary systems are born.

  Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). This is the first time that ALMA has
  ever observed the surface of a star and this first attempt has resulted in the highest-resolution
  image of Betelgeuse available. Betelgeuse is one of the largest stars currently
  known — with a radius around 1400 times larger than the Sun’s in the millimeter
  continuum. About 600 light-years away in the constellation of Orion (The Hunter),
  the red supergiant burns brightly, causing it to have only a short life expectancy.
  The star is just about eight million years old, but is already on the verge of becoming
  a supernova. When that happens, the resulting explosion will be visible from Earth,
  even in broad daylight. The star has been observed in many other wavelengths, particularly
  in the visible, infrared, and ultraviolet. Using ESO’s Very Large Telescope astronomers
  discovered a vast plume of gas almost as large as our Solar System. Astronomers
  have also found a gigantic bubble that boils away on Betelgeuse’s surface. These
  features help to explain how the star is shedding gas and dust at tremendous rates
  (eso0927, eso1121). In this picture, ALMA observes the hot gas of the lower chromosphere
  of Betelgeuse at sub-millimeter wavelengths — where localised increased temperatures
  explain why it is not symmetric. Scientifically, ALMA can help us to understand

description: '  This spectacular spiral galaxy, known as NGC 1964, resides approximately
  70 million light-years away in the constellation of Lepus (The Hare). NGC 1964 has
  a bright and dense core. This core sits within a mottled oval disc, which is itself
  encircled by distinct spiral arms speckled with bright starry regions. The brilliant
  centre of the galaxy caught the eye of the astronomer William Herschel on the night
  of 20 November 1784, leading to the galaxy’s discovery and subsequent documentation
  in the New General Catalogue.  In addition to containing stars, NGC 1964 lives in
  a star-sprinkled section of the sky. In this view from the Wide Field Imager (WFI)
  — an instrument mounted on the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope at ESO’s La Silla Observatory,
  Chile — the star HD 36785 can be seen to the galaxy’s immediate right. Above it
  reside two other prominent stars named HD 36784 and TYC 5928-368-1 — and the large
  bright star below NGC 1964 is known as BD-22 1147.  This view of NGC 1964 also contains
  an array of galaxies, visible in the background. The WFI is able to observe the
  light from these distant galaxies, and those up to 40 million times fainter than
  the human eye can see.  '

description: 'This image from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)
  shows V1247 Orionis, a young, hot star surrounded by a dynamic ring of gas and dust,
  known as a circumstellar disc. This disc can be seen here in two parts: a clearly
  defined central ring of matter and a more delicate crescent structure located further
  out. The region between the ring and crescent, visible as a dark strip, is thought
  to be caused by a young planet carving its way through the disc. As the planet orbits
  around its parent star, its motion creates areas of high pressure on either side
  of its path, similar to how a ship creates bow waves as it cuts through water. These
  areas of high pressure could become protective barriers around sites of planet formation;
  dust particles are trapped within them for millions of years, allowing them the
  time and space to clump together and grow. The exquisite resolution of ALMA allows
  astronomers to study the intricate structure of such a dust trapping vortex for
  the first time. The image reveals not only the crescent-shaped dust trap at the
  outer edge of the dark strip, but also regions of excess dust within the ring, possibly
  indicating a second dust trap that formed inside of the potential planet’s orbit.
  This confirms the predictions of earlier computer simulations. Dust trapping is
  one potential solution to a major stumbling block in current theories of how planets
  form, which predicts that particles should drift into the central star and be destroyed
  before they have time to grow to planetesimal sizes (the radial drift problem).

description: This image from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)
  shows MWC 758, a young star that is approaching adulthood and surrounded by knotty,
  irregular rings of cosmic dust, three of which can be seen here. Unusually, these
  rings are elliptical in shape rather than being perfectly circular — making this
  the first discovery of an intrinsically elliptical protoplanetary disc with ALMA!
  The outer and inner rings each contain one particularly bright clump, visible as
  arcs of yellow.  Additionally there appear to be spiral arms traced out within the
  dust, as well as a core dust-free cavity that is slightly off-centre. These are
  all features that hint at the presence of unseen planets. As planets form, they
  gravitationally interact with the disc and create various telltale features and
  structures. Astronomers can thus observe a system like MWC 758 and not only infer
  the existence of potential hidden planets, but also estimate their masses, locations,
  and orbits. This is a wonderful example of the planet-finding power of ALMA. Using
  the observatory to study such dusty discs allows scientists to investigate the very
  first stages of planet formation in a bid to understand how these infant systems
  form and evolve. Learning more about planetary systems throughout the cosmos may
  help us know more about how the Solar System formed, and how it evolved to become
  the cosmic home we live in today.

description: The constellation of Orion (The Hunter) is one of the most recognisable
  collections of stars in the night sky. We have noted Orion’s prominent stars for
  tens of thousands of years at least, and likely far longer. Chinese astronomers
  called it 参宿 or Shēn, literally “three stars”, for its three bright dots (which
  form the Hunter’s belt). The ancient Egyptians regarded it as the gods Sah and Sopdet,
  manifestations of Osiris and Isis, respectively, whereas Greek astronomers saw a
  brave hunter — the eponymous Orion — with his sword above his head, ready to strike.
  Mythology aside, Orion is a fascinating patch of sky. This image, from ESO&#x27;s
  Very Large Telescope, shows a reflection nebula nestled at the heart of the constellation
  — NGC 2023. Located close to the well-known Horsehead and Flame Nebulae, NGC 2023
  lurks about 1500 light-years away from Earth, and is one of the largest reflection
  nebulae in the sky. Reflection nebulae are clouds of interstellar dust that reflect
  the light from nearby or internal sources, like fog around a car headlight. NGC
  2023 is illuminated by a massive young star named HD 37903. The star is extremely
  hot — several times hotter than the Sun — and its bright blue-white light causes
  NGC 2023’s milky glow. Such nebulae are often the birthplaces of stars, and contain
  a clumpy distribution of gas that’s significantly denser than the surrounding medium.
  Under the influence of gravity, these clumps attract one another and merge, eventually
  creating a new star. In a few million years time, Orion&#x27;s Belt may gain a new
  star! The image was taken with the VLT’s FORS (FOcal Reducer and Spectrograph) instrument
  as part of the ESO Cosmic Gems programme. This initiative produces images of interesting
  and visually attractive objects using ESO telescopes, for the purposes of education
  and outreach. The programme makes use of telescope time that cannot be used for
  science observations. All data collected may also be suitable for scientific purposes,
  and are made available to astronomers through ESO’s science archive.

  Formed by a colossal supernova explosion in the year 1054, the Crab Nebula consists
  of the outer layers of a now-dead massive star strewn across a region of space roughly
  10 light-years across. The ripple-like structures visible in this image emanate
  from the heart of the nebula, where a pulsar — the dense, quickly rotating remains
  of the supernova’s progenitor star — is unleashing a hail of charged particles into
  the surrounding gas. The boundary where these charged particles slow down and pile
  up creates the bright ripples shown here. These ripples then expand outward over
  the course of months, causing the Crab Nebula to resemble a pool of disturbed water
  on an unimaginably vast scale.

description: Known as the N44 superbubble complex, this cloudy tempest is dominated
  by a vast bubble about 325 by 250 light-years across. A cluster of massive stars
  inside the cavern has cleared away gas to form a distinctive mouth-shaped hollow
  shell. While astronomers do not agree on exactly how this bubble has evolved, for
  as long as 10 million years, they do know that the central cluster of massive stars
  is responsible for the cloud’s unusual appearance. It is likely that the explosive
  death of one or more of the cluster’s most massive and short-lived stars played
  a key role in the formation of the large bubble. The image provides one of the most
  detailed views ever obtained of this relatively large region in the Large Magellanic
  Cloud, a satellite galaxy to the Milky Way, located some 150,000 light-years away
  and visible from the Southern Hemisphere. The image captures light of specific colors
  that reveal the compression of material and the presence of gases (primarily excited
  hydrogen gas and lesser amounts of oxygen and “shocked” sulfur) in the cloud. Multiple
  smaller bubbles appear in the image as bulbous growths clinging to the central superbubble.
  Most of these regions were probably formed as part of the same process that shaped
  the central cluster. Their formation could also have been “sparked” by compression
  as the central stars pushed the surrounding gas outward. Our view into this cavern
  is believed to be like looking through an elongated tube, which gives the object
  its monstrous mouth-like appearance.

description: Gemini&#x27;s Laser Vision Reveals Striking New Details in Orion Nebula
  This composite image at infrared wavelengths was obtained using the Gemini North
  laser guide star system in conjunction with the ALTAIR adaptive optics system and
  the NIRI near-infrared imager. The image shows the Orion &quot;bullets&quot; as
  blue features and represents the light emitted by hot iron (Fe) gas. The light from
  the wakes, shown in orange, is from excited hydrogen gas.This image brings into
  focus a remarkably detailed view of supersonic “bullets” of gas and the wakes created
  as they pierce through clouds of molecular hydrogen in the famous Orion Nebula.
  The image was made possible with laser guide star adaptive optics technology that
  corrects in real-time for image distortions caused by the Earth’s atmosphere. The
  Orion bullets were first seen in a visible-light image in 1983. By 1992, images
  taken at infrared wavelengths led astronomers to conclude that these clumps of gas
  were being ejected from deep within the nebula following an unknown violent event
  connected with the recent formation of a cluster of massive stars there. The bullets
  are speeding outward from the cloud at up to 400 kilometers (250 miles) per second
  – more than a thousand times faster than the speed of sound. The name “bullet” is
  somewhat misleading since these objects are made of gas and truly gigantic. The
  typical size of one of the bullet’s tips is about ten times the size of Pluto’s
  orbit around the Sun. The wakes shown in the image are about a fifth of a light-year
  long. Clouds of iron atoms at the tip of each bullet glow brightly (blue in this
  image) as they are shock-heated by friction to around 5000°C (9,000°F). Molecular
  hydrogen, which makes up the bulk of both the bullets and the surrounding gas cloud,
  is destroyed at the tips by the violent collisions between the high-speed bullets
  and the surrounding cloud. However, on the trailing edges of the bullets the hydrogen
  molecules are not destroyed, but instead are heated to about 2000°C (4000°F). As
  the bullets plow through the clouds they leave behind distinctive tubular wakes
  (colored orange in this image). These wakes shine like bullet tracers due to the
  heated molecular hydrogen gas. The bullets are relatively young, with their ages
  estimated to be less than a thousand years since ejection.

description: This Gemini North telescope image reveals no less than six gas jets emerging
  at supersonic speeds from the reddish Herbig-Haro 24 (HH 24) complex — a small cluster
  of young stars embedded in a molecular cloud some 1,300 light years distant in the
  constellation Orion. It is the most detailed image ever obtained from the ground
  of this remarkable region, which contains the highest concentration of jets known
  anywhere. One jet is highly disturbed, suggesting that the source may be a close
  binary whose orbit perturbs the jet body. This dynamic environment also may be responsible
  for expelling some of the lowest mass stars in the area. Most puzzling are the five
  very-low-mass protostars seen well outside the star-forming cloud core. As the gas
  is far too tenuous for the stars to have formed in their present locations, these
  orphaned protostars were most likely ejected shortly after birth from the core,
  which hosts a small multiple protostellar system known as SSV 63. Such ejections
  may occur when the crowded stars start moving around each other in a chaotic dance,
  ultimately leading to the ejection of the smallest ones. The bright nebulous star
  to the south is the visible T Tauri star SSV 59.

description: 'In the heart of the Crab Nebula (Messier 1) a neutron star is rotating
  30 times every single second. This pirouetting star, known as the Crab Pulsar, consists
  purely of neutrons, and has an intense magnetic field which ejects jets of material
  from its poles at nearly the speed of light. The Crab Pulsar has a mass about one
  and a half times that of our Sun, yet all this mass is packed into a sphere only
  28 km (17 miles) in diameter — roughly the size of Mars’s small moon Phobos. The
  wispy structures shown in this image are caused by material flowing equatorially
  outwards from the pulsar and careening into the surrounding nebula. These dynamic
  features, known as termination shocks, move and change shape as outflow from the
  puslar ebbs and flows.  This changeability is showcased by this composite image,
  which is a compilation of three Gemini North observations taken over a 5-year period
  at the same infrared wavelength: observations from October 2009 are shown in blue
  and observations from December 2014 are shown in red. This color coding of the observations
  produces a striking rainbow effect highlighting the high speed motion of the termination
  shocks, which have noticeably changed position between observations. Gemini North
  on Maunakea, Hawai‘i, is one of the pair of telescopes that make up the international
  Gemini Observatory, a Program of NSF’s NOIRLab.'

description: 'This picture shows the great nebula in the constellation of Orion the
  Hunter. On a good clear night, from a dark site well away from the lights of modern
  civilization, this glowing cloud of gas and dust can be seen with the naked eye
  as a fuzzy patch surrounding the star Theta Orionis in the Hunter&#x27;s Sword,
  below Orion&#x27;s belt. It is probably the most spectacular of all the objects
  cataloged by Charles Messier and now called by their `M&#x27; numbers. M42 had been
  known since the beginnings of recorded astronomy as a star, but it is so outstanding
  that it was first noted as an extended nebula in 1610, only a year after Galileo&#x27;s
  first use of the telescope. Detailed descriptions started appearing later in the
  seventeenth century, and it has been a popular target for anyone with a telescope
  ever since. So many details are visible in even a small telescope that M42 will
  more than repay the observer who makes it a frequent target, and who will find that
  it is hard to make a realistic sketch that can capture all of the finer features.
  M42 is our closest example of an HII region, being composed mainly of ionized hydrogen
  which gives off the red glow so dominant in every picture of the nebula. Deep photographs
  such as this one show that it is nearly a degree across, larger than the full Moon
  (although the Moon is so bright that it looks much larger). The energy to keep the
  nebula glowing comes from the very hot young stars in a formation called the Trapezium,
  embedded in the brightest part of the nebula and not visible in this photograph.
  The nebula and the brighter stars are very young indeed by astronomical standards,
  at about 30000 years. Compare this to our own Sun, which is considered to be a middle-aged
  star at over 4 billion years! M42 probably contains several hundred stars younger
  than a million years, still bursting with the energy of youth. Stars are still being
  born in a dense cloud behind the nebula, but they are hidden from our view by a
  concentration of dust which reduces their light to only a million-millionth of its
  original intensity. Fortunately, astronomers have developed special cameras and
  other detectors which are sensitive to infra-red radiation, more popularly known
  as heat, which penetrates the dust and reveals to us this stellar nursery. Although
  M42 is mostly hydrogen, in both neutral and ionized states, with a fair quantity
  of dust, it does contain significant amounts of other elements, especially oxygen.
  The green glow of doubly-ionized oxygen is strongest near the intense ultraviolet
  starlight at the middle of the nebula. To the north-east (the lower left in this
  picture, which is oriented with north to the left) is a feature called the Dark
  Bay, which is a thick cloud of neutral gas which has not yet been ionized. M42,

description: 'This color picture was made by combining several exposures taken on
  the night of December 28th 1994 (UT of observation 29/12/94 around 04:00) with a
  2048x2048 CCD detector at the 0.9m telescope of the Kitt Peak National Observatory.
  Observing conditions were not ideal throughout, and so only a select few of the
  original observations were used. The final tally used five frames in the B (blue)
  filter for a total of 22 minutes, three frames with the V (green) filter, 15 minutes,
  and two with the R (red), total 10 minutes. Each frame was carefully cleaned, a
  particularly difficult task for the blue filter due to internal reflection problems
  in the telescope, and then aligned and combined by computer to create this (approximately)
  true color picture. The pixel size on the sky is 0.68 arc seconds; after combination,
  the final size is 1480x1366, or about 17x15 arc minutes. Orientation of thumbnail
  image: N to the left, E down. About this object The Horsehead Nebula, a part of
  the optical nebula IC434 and also known as Barnard 33, was first recorded in 1888
  on a photographic plate taken at the Harvard College Observatory. Its coincidental
  appearance as the profile of a horse&#x27;s head and neck has led to its becoming
  one of the most familiar astronomical objects. It is, in fact, an extremely dense
  cloud projecting in front of the ionized gas that provides the pink glow so nicely
  revealed in this picture. We know this not only because the underside of the &#x27;neck&#x27;
  is especially dark, but because it actually casts a shadow on the field to its east
  (below the &#x27;muzzle&#x27;). The marked change in the density of stars visible
  on either side indicates that the strip of glowing hydrogen marks the edge of a
  substantial dark cloud. As a cloud core emerging from its parental cloud, and as
  an active site of low-mass star formation, the Horsehead is a simple system of considerable
  use for testing models of photodissociation regions, and revealing the intricate
  interrelations between gas, dust, and the light from hot stars. Polarization maps
  suggest that the entire region is illuminated by the bright OB star Sigma Orionis,
  which is also responsible for exciting the emission nebula. (The much brighter Zeta
  Orionis is a foreground star, not related to the nebulosity.) The &#x27;streamers&#x27;
  visible in the brighter region appear to be due to a magnetic field which leaves
  the Horsehead cloud approximately radially, having been entrained by outflowing
  matter. Small red spots in the base of the Horsehead betray the presence of hidden
  protostars, and red streaks near the yellowish nebula surrounding V615 Orionis (bottom
  left) are Herbig-Haro objects, which are jets of material ejected from protostars.
  The Horsehead is a fascinating, active, and complex neighborhood. Location: 05 38
  27 -02 29 (1950.0), constellation of Orion. Distance: about 1600 light-years.'

description: The famous Crab Nebula, Messier object 1 and NGC1952. This image of the
  well-known Crab Nebula was taken using Ektachrome film at the prime focus of the
  Kitt Peak 4-meter telescope on October 1st 1973. This is unusual because most astronomical
  pictures are coloured by combining three different exposures taken through red,
  green and blue filters. In this relatively short exposure, the pulsar is clearly
  visible (slightly below and to the right of the central star, which is actually
  a projected foreground object). North is up with east to the left.  About this object
  The Crab Nebula was originally given this name due to its resemblance to a crab&#x27;s
  claw (not the full-body image of a crab), in an early sketch made in 1855 by Lord
  Rosse&#x27;s staff astronomer R.J. Mitchell. With higher resolution pictures, this
  appearance became far less compelling, but the name has stuck. It is the remnant
  of a supernova explosion in the year 1054 A.D., which was recorded in five separate
  accounts from Chinese astronomers in the Far East. It is perhaps odd that no western
  observation has survived, since it was certainly one of the most spectacular historical
  supernovae. The red tendrils are excited gas, emitting strong H-alpha radiation.
  The nebula was probably first noticed in 1731 by John Bevis, and it was significant
  enough to be the first entry in Charles Messier&#x27;s list of nebulae (compiled
  to avoid mistaking them for comets). The nebula continues to expand and change the
  details of its appearance, and this is partly due to the violence of the original
  explosion. However, the star which exploded left behind a rotating neutron star,
  which continues to beam energy out into the nebula, as well as flashing with a period
  of only 33 milliseconds. The details of this energy input are important for our
  understanding both of neutron stars and of the physical conditions in the nebula,
  and are revealed in the patterns of filaments, their brightness and colors, and
  the way they change with time. Despite the name, it is actually in the constellation
  Taurus. Photograph by Bill Schoening.

description: This image of 30 Doradus, the Tarantula Nebula, in the Large Magellanic
  Cloud (LMC) was taken with the Curtis Schmidt telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American
  Observatory (CTIO) in Chile, as part of the Magellanic Cloud Emission Line Survey
  (MCELS) project. The Tarantula Nebula is a giant star-forming region, where energy
  from hot, young stars in the region creates dramatic voids and filaments in the
  surrounding gas. Located 160,000 light-years distant in the southern constellation
  Dorado, the LMC is considered the closest large galaxy to Earth. Because of the
  proximity and low foreground absorption of the LMC, it is an ideal laboratory both
  for studies of individual HII regions, supernova remnants, and superbubbles, and
  for investigations of global properties using samples of these objects. MCELS is
  designed to provide uniform datasets in optical emission lines that are necessary
  to conduct this research. The MCELS observations toward the 30 Doradus region have
  been used to investigate the physical properties of the HII region, examine the
  physical conditions of supernova remnants in the field, and study the large-scale
  structure of the ionized gas. This color image was produced using three separate
  exposures taken in hydrogen (red), sulfur (green), and oxygen (blue) filters.

description: NOAO astronomers captured this spectacular panorama of star formation
  with the National Science Foundation&#x27;s 0.9-meter telescope on Kitt Peak. Located
  in the constellation of Orion (the Hunter), the area in this image is located about
  two degrees south of the Orion Nebula, where a surviving portion of one of Orion&#x27;s
  giant molecular clouds (known as &quot;Orion A&quot;) is continuing to spawn new
  stars. Powerful jets of outflowing gas are often the first visible manifestations
  of the birth of young stars. These jets punch holes through the opaque clouds in
  which the star is formed, holes through which the light of the new-born stars can
  escape to produce what are known as reflection nebulae. Several such nebulae are
  seen in this image. The bright object below and to the left of center is the reflection
  nebula NGC1999, which contains the young star V380 Orionis. A small, triangle shaped
  patch of dusty material is seen in silhouette against the reflection nebula. NGC1999
  lies at the center of a network of nebulous filaments which billow out and away
  like the spokes of a bicycle wheel. These features may trace a wide-angle wind emerging
  from NGC1999. Near the upper half of the image, bright young stars in a forming
  cluster named L1641N light up another reflection nebula which contains several dense
  clumps of opaque material. Infrared images have identified over 50 forming stars
  in this region. More than six jets and outflows are erupting from this region. Outflowing
  jets from young stars also power luminous shock waves known as Herbig-Haro (HH)
  objects, which move through the surrounding gas at speeds of up to hundreds of kilometers
  per second (over 100,000 miles an hour). As these shock waves ram their surroundings,
  they heat up bow-shaped nebulae of glowing plasma. This image shows dozens of such
  objects. The region below the NGC1999 reflection nebula contains a cluster of deeply
  embedded young stars which power oppositely directed bow shocks. These objects were
  first recognized by Guillermo Haro and George Herbig around 1950 and today they
  are known as HH 1 and HH 2. Recent observations indicate that the cone shape located
  near the right edge of the image (known as HH 401) may be a giant bow shock powered
  by the source of the HH 1 &amp; 2 outflow. If so, this outflow is more than 10 light-years
  long! The arc of light which looks like a waterfall (located above and to the left
  of HH 401) is the enigmatic object HH 222. Unlike most other HH objects, it is a
  source of polarized, non-thermal radio waves. The nature of this feature remains
  largely unknown. Between HH 401 and HH 222 runs a long chain of Herbig-Haro objects
  associated with the object HH 34. HH 34 itself is the bright and compact bow shock
  located near the bottom of HH 222. Just above HH 34, a compact jet can be seen to
  emerge from the source star, which is not visible in this image. This jet and its
  first bow shock (HH 34) mark the inner portion of a chain of shocks which trace
  a graceful S-shaped curve from the upper right hand corner of the image down towards
  HH 1 &amp; 2. The north end of the flow is just below the top of the image (objects
  HH 33 &amp; 40); the south end of the flow terminates in a group of small bow shocks
  known as HH 86 &amp; 87, which reside in the dark region between HH 401 and NGC
  1999. Many other smaller nebulous patches in this image mark small reflection nebulae,
  Herbig-Haro objects, and stellar jets. The rich detail in this image reveals one
  of the most fascinating areas of the night sky.

  Known as the N44 superbubble complex, this turbulent emission nebula is dominated
  by a vast bubble about 325 by 250 light-years across. The bubble’s interior is formed
  either by massive winds produced by a cluster of a few to many OB stars combined
  with the remnant shell of old supernovae. If you look closely along the right of
  the nebula you can discern the presence of a second bubble. As superbubbles expand
  and age their surface brightness diminishes. Finally it is thought that superbubbles
  can trigger new star formation in areas of the shells where gases condense.

description: This exceptional image of the Horsehead nebula was taken at the National
  Science Foundation&#x27;s 0.9-meter telescope on Kitt Peak with the NOAO Mosaic
  CCD camera. Located in the constellation of Orion, the Hunter, the Horsehead is
  part of a dense cloud of gas in front of an active star-forming nebula known as
  IC434. The nebulosity of the Horsehead is believed to be excited by the bright star
  Sigma Orionis, which is located above the top of the image. Just off the left side
  of the image is the bright star Zeta Orionis, which is the easternmost of the three
  stars that form Orion&#x27;s belt. Zeta Orionis is a foreground star, and is not
  related to the nebula. The streaks in the nebulosity that extend above the Horsehead
  are likely due to magnetic fields within the nebula. Close study reveals that many
  more stars are visible in the top half of the image. Stars in the lower half of
  the image are obscured by a dark cloud of hydrogen gas. The edge of this large cloud
  is the horizontal strip of glowing gas that bisects the image. The Horsehead is
  located about 1,600 light-years away from Earth. The area shown in this image is
  quite large on the sky, covering about five times the area of the full Moon. This
  false-color image was created by combining emission-line images taken in hydrogen-alpha
  (red), oxygen [OIII] (green) and sulfur [SII] (blue).

description: This spectacular image of the star AE Aurigae and its surrounding nebulosity
  was taken at the National Science Foundation&#x27;s 0.9-meter telescope on Kitt
  Peak with the NOAO Mosaic CCD camera. Located in the constellation of Auriga, the
  Charioteer, AE Aurigae is the bright blue star at the center of the image. The incredible
  energy from this hot, massive star is energizing the surrounding gas, causing it
  to glow dramatically. As a result it is also known as &quot;the flaming star&quot;.
  This false-color image was created by combining emission-line images taken in Hydrogen-alpha
  (yellow), Oxygen [OIII] (violet) and Sulfur [SII] (blue).

description: The glowing gas of the interstellar medium (ISM) is the breeding ground
  for the formation of new stars, and the cemetery where the ashes of dead stars ultimately
  return. A team led by astronomers from the National Optical Astronomy Observatory
  (NOAO) has conducted a new study called the Magellanic Cloud Emission Line Survey
  (MCELS) that focused expressly on the ISM in the Large Magellanic Cloud and Small
  Magellanic Cloud—the nearest major galaxies to the Milky Way. More than 1,500 individual
  images from MCELS have been assembled into this large mosaic of the Large Magellanic
  Cloud, released to the public in Washington, DC, in January 2006 at the annual meeting
  of the American Astronomical Society. See also NOAO Press Release 06-01.

description: 'This wide-field panorama of star formation was captured with the National
  Science Foundation’s Mayall 4-meter telescope on Kitt Peak. Located in the constellation
  of Orion (the Hunter), the image show a portion of one of Orion’s giant molecular
  clouds (known as “Orion A”) where new stars are forming. The bright object in the
  bottom-left corner is the reflection nebula NGC 1999, which contains the young star
  V380 Orionis. A small, triangle shaped patch of dusty material is seen in silhouette
  against the reflection nebula. NGC 1999 lies at the center of a network of nebulous
  filaments which billow out and away like the spokes of a bicycle wheel.  Powerful
  jets of gas are often the first visible manifestations of the birth of young stars.
  These jets punch holes through the opaque clouds in which the star is formed, holes
  through which the light of the new-born stars can escape to produce what are known
  as reflection nebulae. Several such nebulae are seen in this image. Outflowing jets
  from young stars also power luminous shock waves known as Herbig-Haro (HH) objects,
  which move through the surrounding gas at speeds of up to hundreds of kilometers
  per second (over 100,000 miles an hour). As these shock waves ram their surroundings,
  they heat up bow-shaped nebulae of glowing plasma. This image shows dozens of such
  objects.  The region below NGC 1999 reflection nebula contains a cluster of deeply
  embedded young stars. These objects were first recognized by Guillermo Haro and
  George Herbig around 1950 and today they are known as HH 1 and HH 2. Recent observations
  indicate that the cone shape located near the right edge of the image (known as
  HH 401) may be a giant bow shock powered by the source of the HH 1 &amp; 2 outflow.
  If so, this outflow is more than 10 light-years long! The arc of light which looks
  like a waterfall (located above and to the right of the center of the image) is
  the enigmatic object HH 222. Unlike most other HH objects, it is a source of polarized,
  non-thermal radio waves. The nature of this feature remains largely unknown. From
  the upper-right to the lower-right of the image runs a long chain of Herbig-Haro
  objects associated with the object HH 34. HH 34 itself is the bright and compact
  bow shock located near the bottom of HH 222. Just above HH 34, a compact jet can
  be seen to emerge from the source star, which is not visible in this image. This
  jet and its first bow shock (HH 34) mark the inner portion of a chain of shocks
  which trace a graceful S-shaped curve from the upper right hand corner of the image
  down towards HH 1 &amp; 2. The north end of the flow is just below the top of the
  image (objects HH 33 &amp; 40); the south end of the flow terminates in a group
  of small bow shocks known as HH 86 &amp; 87, which reside in the dark region between
  HH 401 and NGC 1999. This image was used as the gorund-based image in Hubble News
  Release Number: STScI-2011-20. Many other smaller nebulous patches in this image
  mark small reflection nebulae, Herbig-Haro objects, and stellar jets. The rich detail
  in this image reveals one of the most fascinating areas of the night sky.'

description: Magnetic fields in the Orion Nebula, shown as streamlines over an infrared
  image taken by the Very Large Telescope in Chile, are regulating the formation of
  new stars. SOFIA&#x27;s HAWC+ instrument is sensitive to the alignment of dust grains,
  which line up along magnetic fields, letting researchers infer the direction and
  strength.
