description: Three-colour composite image of the highly excited nebula near the Wolf-Rayet
  (WR) star BAT99-2 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), obtained in January 2002
  with the FORS1 multi-mode instrument at the 8.2-m VLT MELIPAL telescope at the Paranal
  Observatory (Chile). It is based on three exposures through narrow-band optical
  (interference) filters that isolate the light from specific atoms and ions. In this
  rendering, the blue colour represents the light from singly ionized Helium (He II;
  wavelength 468.6 nm; exposure time 60 min), green corresponds to doubly ionized
  oxygen ([O III]; 495.7 + 500.7 nm; 5 min) and red to hydrogen atoms (H; H-alpha
  line at 656.2 nm; 5 min). Of these three ions, He II is the tracer of high excitation,
  i.e. the bluest areas of the nebula are the hottest. The sky field measures 400
  x 400 square arcsec; the original pixel size on the 2k x 2k CCD is 0.23 arcsec.
  North is up and east to the left.  Before combination, the CCD frames were flat-fielded
  and cleaned of cosmic-rays. Moreover, the stars in the blue (He II) image were removed
  in order to provide a clearer view of the surrounding nebular emission. The reproduced
  brightness is proportional to the square-root of the actual intensity; this increases
  the &quot;dynamical range&quot; of the image, i.e. it shows better areas of very
  different brightness.

description: Appearing as a bird in flight, with wings outstretched in the expanse
  of space, SU Aur, a star much younger and more massive than the Sun, is surrounded
  by a giant planet-forming disc. This image, captured by the SPHERE instrument on
  ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT), shows the disc around SU Aur in unprecedented
  detail, including the long dust trails connected to it. The star itself is obscured
  by the instrument’s coronagraph, a device that blocks the light from the central
  star to allow the less bright features around it to stand out. The dust trails are
  composed of material from an encompassing nebula flowing into the disc. This nebula
  is likely the outcome of a collision between the star and a huge cloud of gas and
  dust, resulting in the unique shape of this planet-forming disc and the surrounding
  dust structure. A new study of SU Aur, which used the VLT and data from other telescopes,
  including the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array, showed that the nebula
  is still feeding material to the planet-forming disc. These new observations highlight
  how complex planet-forming discs can be.

description: The interacting galaxy pair NGC 1532 and NGC 1531 were imaged using the
  Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) at Gemini South in Chile on December 5,
  2004. This view reveals spectacular details in the galactic pair embraced in a fiery
  waltz. The larger galaxy (NGC 1532) is a spiral, and from our point of view within
  the Milky Way it is seen as nearly edge-on. Intense reddish star-forming regions
  spatter the edges of the dusty arms silhouetted in the foreground against the galactic
  disk. The three-dimensional nature of the galaxy is revealed by the background spiral
  arms dimmed by intervening gas and dust. The smaller of the galactic pair (NGC 1531)
  is dwarfed by its larger companion in much the same fashion as the Large Magellanic
  Cloud is by our Milky Way. Hints of interaction between these two galaxies are seen
  in at least two stray associations of stars and glowing red clumps of hydrogen gas.
  A warp in a background spiral arm of NGC 1532 and a possible bridge of matter that
  connect the pair suggest continued influences between the two galaxies. This pair
  is located about 55 million light-years away toward the southern constellation of
  Eridanus. It is part of a larger group that includes at least one other dwarf galaxy
  outside the field of this image. The mass of NGC 1532 is estimated to be slightly
  greater than that of our Milky Way.

description: The blackness of space is punctuated by bright dots. This image could
  almost be mistaken for a particularly detailed shot of the night sky as seen from
  Earth, full of stars. Appearances, however, can be deceptive. This image was taken
  from Earthʻs southern hemisphere, but the bright dots are not stars — they are galaxies.
  In fact, the distinctive, ring-shaped galaxy on the right is LEDA 14884. This image
  was built up using data from the Dark Energy Survey, an ambitious project which
  mapped hundreds of millions of galaxies across the Universe. This was done using
  the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), an instrument built by the Department of Energy
  and mounted at the Víctor M. Blanco 4-meter Telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American
  Observatory (CTIO), a Program of NSF’s NOIRLab.  Looking at this incredible image,
  with its thousands of wildly diverse galaxies, it is mind-boggling to recall that
  only about 100 years ago, most astronomers believed that our Milky Way was the only
  galaxy in existence. It was not until 1925 that Edwin Hubble, building upon the
  work of Henrietta Leavitt and Ejnar Hertzsprung, proved that the Andromeda Galaxy
  must lie beyond the Milky Way, and humanity began to recognize the sheer scope of
  the Universe.

description: 'Gas-rich galaxies display a wide range of structures and properties,
  but one thing they all seem to have are some newly formed stars. Images from the
  Survey for Ionization in Neutral Gas Galaxies (SINGG), an NOAO Survey Program (obtained
  with the CTIO 1.5m telescope), are designed to highlight areas of star formation
  in gas rich galaxies. This image shows a strong interaction between the barred spiral
  NGC1512 and its Blue Compact Dwarf (BCD) companion, NGC1510. Star formation in NGC1512
  is concentrated into two rings; the inner one has the strength of a starburst. Surprisingly
  star formation is even stronger in the BCD NGC1510, which can be seen to the lower
  right of NGC1512. This pair ilustrate how galaxy interactions are able to trigger
  starbursts. The image is displayed so that stars have a cyan-blue appearance, while
  ionized hydrogen (H-alpha) emission appears orange-red to yellow. The H-alpha emission
  marks where the gas in the galaxies has been stripped of electrons, and is now recombining.
  It takes very hot O stars to ionize the gas; these stars have very short lifetimes
  (a few million years). As a result, red tones in these images typically mark the
  location of newly formed hot stars. Gerhardt Meurer of The Johns Hopkins University,
  Baltimore, MD, is the principal investigator for SINGG. For more information, see:

description: An image of N11 in the Large Magellanic Cloud, taken with the Curtis
  Schmidt telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) as part of the
  Magellanic Clouds Emission-Line Survey (MCELS). This color image was produced using
  three separate exposures taken in hydrogen, sulfur and oxygen bandpasses. It was
  used to support the July 2004 release by the Hubble Heritage project.

description: The interacting galaxy pair NGC1532 and NGC1531 were imaged using the
  Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) at Gemini South in Chile on December 5,
  2004. This view reveals spectacular details in the galactic pair embraced in a fiery
  waltz. The larger galaxy (NGC1532) is a spiral, and from our point of view within
  the Milky Way it is seen as nearly edge-on. Intense reddish star-forming regions
  spatter the edges of the dusty arms silhouetted in the foreground against the galactic
  disk. The three-dimensional nature of the galaxy is revealed by the background spiral
  arms dimmed by intervening gas and dust. The smaller of the galactic pair (NGC1531)
  is dwarfed by its larger companion in much the same fashion as the Large Magellanic
  Cloud is by our Milky Way. Hints of interaction between these two galaxies are seen
  in at least two stray associations of stars and glowing red clumps of hydrogen gas.
  A warp in a background spiral arm of NGC1532 and a possible bridge of matter that
  connect the pair suggest continued influences between the two galaxies. This pair
  is located about 55 million light-years away toward the southern constellation of
  Eridanus. It is part of a larger group that includes at least one other dwarf galaxy
  outside the field of this image. The mass of NGC1532 is estimated to be slightly
  greater than that of our Milky Way.

description: T Tauri is a famous variable star in the constellation of Taurus. In
  this image, it is the star at the center of the image, embedded in dust and gas.
  The nebula itself is known as NGC 1555. T Tauri is the prototype for a class of
  stars (known collectively as &quot;T Tau stars&quot;) that are notable because they
  are very young stars in the process of forming. These stars have just recently emerged
  from the dense dust and gas &quot;cocoons&quot; from which they formed.
