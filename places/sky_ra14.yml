description: This image is a colour-composite of the barred spiral galaxy NGC 5584.
  It is based on data collected by the Paranal Science Team with the FORS1 instrument
  on Kueyen, the second 8.2-m Unit Telescope of ESO&#x27;s Very Large Telescope. The
  supernova SN 2007af is the bright object seen slightly below and to the right of
  the galaxy&#x27;s centre. The galaxy and its bright supernova were observed on the
  nights of 16, 19 and 22 March 2007 through a B, V, R, H-alpha and OII filter. The
  total exposure time is about 28 minutes. The observers are Susana Randall, Claudio
  Melo and Swetlana Hubrig, and the day astronomer was Dominique Naef (all ESO). Henri
  Boffin (ESO) processed the data and made the colour-composite, and Haennes Heyer
  (ESO) made the final adjustments.

  years later, when clues from a spectrum obtained with ESO&#x27;s Very Large Telescope
  led the team to start the real detective work of searching through data from 18
  different telescopes, both ground- and space-based, nearly all of which was in the

  and PDS 70c, surrounded by a circumplanetary disc (the dot to the right of the star).
  The planets have carved a cavity in the circumstellar disc (the ring-like structure
  that dominates the image) as they gobbled up material from the disc itself, growing
  in size. It was during this process that PDS 70c acquired its own circumplanetary
  disc, which contributes to the growth of the planet and where moons can form.

  is somewhat uncertain, possibly around 5,000 light-years.  Like the Butterfly Nebula
  (cf. VLT UT1 First Light Photo No. 4), IC 4406 belongs to the class of bipolar nebulae.
  However, the dark and dusty central band (the &quot;disc-like structure&quot;) is
  less pronounced in this object and the internal structure is more uniform. The different
  colours correspond to regions of different composition and physical properties.
  This is a combination of two 5-min B (blue) exposures (seeing 0.95 arcsec), two
  5-min V (green-yellow) exposures (0.90 arcsec), and one 5-min and two 2-min R (red)

  this image from the VIMOS instrument on ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT). The two
  interacting galaxies — NGC 5426 and NGC 5427 — together form an intriguing astronomical
  object named Arp 271, the subject of this, the final image captured by VIMOS before
  it was decommissioned on 24 March 2018. VIMOS — or, in full, the VIsible Multi-Object
  Spectrograph — was active on the VLT for an impressive 16 years. During that time
  it helped scientists to uncover the wild early lives of massive galaxies, observe
  awe-inspiring triple-galaxy interactions, and explore deep cosmic questions such
  as how the Universe’s most massive galaxies grew so large. Instead of focusing on
  single objects, VIMOS was able to capture detailed information about hundreds of
  galaxies at once. This sensitive instrument collected the spectra of tens of thousands
  of galaxies throughout the Universe, showing how they formed, grew, and evolved.
  Arp 271 is framed against a backdrop of distant galaxies in this view, and wisps
  of bluish gas, dust and young stars can be seen bridging the gap between the two
  galaxies — a result of their mutual gravitational interaction. Like many astronomical
  observations, this image looks back in time. Thanks to the vast gulf of space separating
  the Earth and Arp 271, this image shows how the galaxies looked over 110 million
  years ago: the amount of time it has taken their light to reach us. This kind of

  scientists believe will undergo a similar interaction with our neighbouring galaxy

description: 'This ESO Picture of the Week shows the centre of a galaxy named NGC
  5643. This galaxy is located 55 million light-years from Earth in the constellation
  of Lupus (The Wolf), and is known as a Seyfert galaxy. Seyfert galaxies have very
  luminous centres — thought to be powered by material being accreted onto a supermassive
  black hole lurking within — that can also be shrouded and obscured by clouds of
  dust and intergalactic material. As a result, it can be difficult to observe the
  active centre of a Seyfert galaxy. NGC 5643 poses a further challenge; it is viewed
  at a high inclination, making it even trickier to view its inner workings. However,
  scientists have used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) together
  with archival data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument
  on ESO’s Very Large Telescope to reveal this view of NGC 5643 — complete with energetic
  outflowing ionised gas pouring out into space. These impressive outflows stretch
  out on either side of the galaxy, and are caused by matter being ejected from the
  accretion disc of the supermassive black hole at NGC 5643’s core. Combined, the
  ALMA and VLT data show the galaxy’s central region to have two distinct components:
  a spiraling, rotating disc (visible in red) consisting of cold molecular gas traced
  by carbon monoxide, and the outflowing gas, traced by ionised oxygen and hydrogen
  (in blue-orange hues) perpendicular to the inner nuclear disc.'

description: The well-known spiral galaxy M101 was imaged by Dr George Jacoby at the
  Kitt Peak National Observatory&#x27;s 0.9-meter telescope, using the new wide-field
  imaging system Mosaic. This instrument combines the pictures from eight separate
  CCD chips, carefully mounted next to each other for a total of 8192 pixels square,
  and can thus image a large area without sacrificing resolution. M101 (NGC5457) is
  a type Sc spiral galaxy in the constellation Ursa Major and is quite similar to
  our own Galaxy.

  of three galaxies that are gravitationally interacting. The large spiral galaxy
  at the center is NGC 5566. Below and to its left is the small, blue spiral galaxy
  NGC 5569. At the top of the image is the distorted spiral NGC 5560. It is presumably
  distorted by the gravity of NGC 5569. The image was generated with observations
  in B (blue), V (green) and I (red) filters. In this image, North is left, East is

description: This image was obtained with the wide-field view of the Mosaic Camera

  as the Pinwheel Galaxy, M101 is a spiral galaxy that is seen face on. It is a galaxy
  similar to our own galaxy, the Milky Way. It is relatively close by, only about
  20 million light years away, meaning that we can see detail inside very well. The
  spiral arms of M101 are filled with numerous regions in which stars are forming
  (seen as pink clouds of gas). This image was made with the U (violet), B (blue),
  V (green), I (orange), and Hydrogen alpha (red) filters. In this image, North is

description: This first release from the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey (NDWFS) consists
  of the optical images in 1.15 x 1.15 degrees (pixel size 0.258 arc seconds) of the
  Bootes field, one of the two NDWFS sky fields. Covering roughly 7 percent of the
  total survey area, this region contains approximately 300,000 galaxies and stars.
  The center of the Bootes field is J143205.7+341647.5. More than five million galaxies
  and 10 billion years of cosmic evolution are being studied by the NDWFS. This deep
  optical and infrared imaging survey of 18 square degrees of the sky will enable
  astronomers to study large-scale structure in the Universe, the formation and evolution
  of galaxies and quasars, rare stellar populations, and the structure of the Milky
  Way. The color composite image was generated by Dr. Nigel Sharp and Mark Hanna of
  NOAO from processed NDWFS images. The region was imaged using the Mayall 4-meter
  telescope and MOSAIC imager at the National Science Foundation&#x27;s Kitt Peak
  National Observatory (KPNO) near Tucson, AZ. Buell T. Jannuzi and Arjun Dey of NOAO
  are co-Principal Investigators for the NDWFS. This image was the subject of a press
  release during the 197th meeting of the American Astronomical Society held in January
  2001 (release date January 8, 2001). Warning ! Please note that the full resolution
  images are enormous !! In order to indicate the quality of the data, three randomly
  selected 1024x1024 pieces of this image are separately available for download as
  688kb JPEG files.
