description: NGC 5189 imaged at Gemini South. NGC 5189, a chaotic-looking planetary
  nebula that lies about 550 parsecs (1,800 light-years) away in the southern hemisphere
  constellation Musca, is a parallelogram-shaped cloud of glowing gas. The GMOS image
  of this nebula shows long streamers of gas, glowing dust clouds, and cometary knots
  pointing away from the central star. Its unruly appearance suggests some extraordinary
  action at the heart of this planetary nebula.

description: This observation from the SMARTS 0.9-meter Telescope at Cerro Tololo
  Inter-American Observatory shows the result of a truly spectacular galactic collision.
  The elliptical galaxy NGC 5291 — the hazy oval cloud at the center of this image
  — was struck by a careening rogue galaxy over 300 million years ago. The aftermath
  of this cataclysmic collision is a ring of galactic debris — visible as the tenuous
  luminous clouds spreading left and right from the golden oval of NGC 5291. This
  image also shows more gentle galactic interactions — NGC 5291 is interacting sedately
  with the unusually curved galaxy to the right of it, which is known as the Seashell.

description: This image of Supernova 2002dj was taken at the 0.9-meter telescope at
  Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) in Chile on 14 June 2002.  SN 2002dj
  is a Type-Ia supernova located in the nearby, early-type galaxy NGC5018. The supernova
  is the bluish object to the right of the galactic center. NGC5018 is located in
  the constellation Coma Berenices, at an estimated distance of 130 million light-years
  from Earth.  The supernova was caught almost two weeks before its maximum light,
  one of the earliest observations to date. The supernova was discovered by D.Hutchings
  and W.D.Li of the Lick Observatory and Tenagra Observatory Supernova Searches (LOTOSS),
  using the 0.8-meter Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope at Lick.  The data shown
  here were taken as part of the CTIO Bright Supernova Project, conducted by Nicholas
  Suntzeff, Chris Smith, Kevin Krisciunas, and Pablo Candia of CTIO. The aim of the
  survey is to characterize Type-Ia supernovae in the infrared where dust extinction
  is very small. These data will be used to measure distances accurate to 5 percent
  for the measurement of the Hubble constant and the acceleration of the Universe.
  Data taken with the CTIO 0.9-meter and YALO 1-meter telescopes, and at the Las Campanas
  Observatory 1-meter and 2.5-meter telescopes (in collaboration with Mark Phillips
  of LCO), will be used in these measurements.

description: The spiral galaxy M51, (the Whirlpool Galaxy) observed with the ODI camera
  on the WIYN telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory, May 2013. Even though the
  galaxy is almost 30 million light years away, the image clearly shows clusters of
  young, hot stars that light up the spiral arms. Threaded through the arms are dark
  “dust lanes”, where sooty material left over from previous generations of stars
  has settled. More dust lanes can be seen in the bridge of luminous stars and gas
  that connects Messier 51 to its companion, the peculiar galaxy NGC 5195, in the
  upper part of the image. For more details, and an alternate version of this image,
  see NOAO press release 1309.

description: Nicknamed the Southern Pinwheel, Messier 83 (or NGC 5236) is a stunning
  face-on spiral galaxy located about 15 million light-years away in the southern
  constellation of Hydra. Its spiral arms are lined with dark lanes of dust and peppered
  with reddish, star-forming clouds of hydrogen gas. One of the deepest images ever
  taken of the Southern Pinwheel (combining more than 11 hours of exposure time),
  this view was captured with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), which was built by the
  US Department of Energy (DOE) and is mounted on the Víctor M. Blanco 4-meter Telescope
  at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO), a Program of NSF’s NOIRLab. Numerous
  background galaxies, which lie much farther away than Messier 83, appear around
  the edges of the image.

  in the direction of the southern-hemisphere constellation Centaurus (The Centaur),
  is the leading light of this striking image. This image provides a spectacular view
  of the luminous glow of stars and dark tendrils of dust that hide the bright center
  of the galaxy. This dust is the result of a past galactic collision, in which a
  giant elliptical galaxy merged with a smaller spiral galaxy. As well as large amounts
  of gas and dust, Centaurus A’s dust lane contains widespread star formation, as
  indicated by the red clouds of hydrogen and by the large numbers of faint blue stars
  visible at each end of the dust lane.  Zoom into the image to see more.

description: Magnetic field streamlines detected by SOFIA are shown over an image
  of the Whirlpool galaxy, M51, from NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope. For the first
  time, SOFIA’s infrared view shows that the magnetic fields in the outer arms do
  not follow the galaxy&#x27;s spiral shape and are instead distorted. The intense
  star formation activity in these regions, shown in red, may be causing the chaos,
  along with the forces from the yellow neighboring galaxy, NGC 5195, tugging on one
  of the spiral arms.
