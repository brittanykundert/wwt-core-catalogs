text> The nearby star-forming cluster NGC 1333 is in
the Perseus molecular cloud, and located approximately 960 light-years away.
Webb’s superb sensitivity allows astronomers to investigate young objects with
extremely low masses. Some of the faintest ‘stars’ in the picture are in fact
newly born free-floating brown dwarfs with masses comparable to those of giant
planets.
